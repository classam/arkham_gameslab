SETUP
=====

Randomly draw 3 of the 8 Combo Move cards and place them face down on the table. Roll a dice and put that dice on top of the card. Turn the first card face up.

Each player has a card. 10 white tokens each.
	- JUMP (Green)
	- ATTACK (Red)
	- MAGIC (Yellow)
	- BLOCK (Blue)
	
Two teams of 2.	
	
	
	
TURNS
=====

Each person secretly distributes 6 points between their 4 areas. Reveal these, then in order each person may move 1 point on their card from one area to any other area.
	
A1 -> B1 -> A2 -> B2

After dice are done, check to see what happened.

Jump/Magic
----------
Check your Jump against either of your opponents Magic. If your Jump is higher than either number, you take no damage. Otherwise you lose White tokens equal to their Magic value.

Attack/Block
------------
Check your Block against either of your opponents Attack. Lose White tokens equal to the difference between their Attack and your Block.



COMBOS
======
Whenever a person performs the action named on the first combo card, with exactly the dice number rolled, that person places their teams coloured token on that card, indicating that they have performed that move. Turn the next card face-up. To continue the combo, someone on that team must perform the next face-up move on their next turn. If neither person on the team performs the next move in the combo on their next turn, take their team marker away and they must start the combo again. Anyone can start a combo, but it counts towards the team and not any particular person.
