SETUP
=====

Randomly draw 3 of the 8 Combo Move cards and place them face down on the table. Roll a dice and put that dice on top of the card. Turn the first card face up.

Each player has a card with 4 areas on it:

   - JUMP (Green)
   - ATTACK (Red)
   - MAGIC (Yellow)
   - BLOCK (Blue)
	
Two teams of 2. Each player has 10 white tokens, indicating life total.	
	
	
	
TURNS
=====

Each person secretly distributes 6 points between their 4 areas using dice. Reveal these, then in order each person may move 1 point on their card from one area to any other area.
	
A1 -> B1 -> A2 -> B2

After dice are done, check to see what happened. Next turn, B1 will adjust points first, and so on.

### Jump/Magic
Check your Jump against either of your opponents Magic. If your Jump is higher than either number, you take no damage. Otherwise you lose White tokens equal to their Magic value.

###Attack/Block
Check your Block against either of your opponents Attack. Lose White tokens equal to the difference between their Attack and your Block.



COMBOS
======
Whenever a person performs the action named on the first combo card, with exactly the dice number displayed on that card, that person places their teams coloured token on that card, indicating that they have performed that move. Turn the next card face-up. To continue the combo, someone on that team must perform the next face-up move on their next turn. If neither person on the team performs the next move in the combo on their next turn, remove their marker from the card. They must start the combo from the beginning. Anyone can start a combo, but it counts towards the team and not any particular person.

Finishing a combo takes 2 white tokens away from both of the players on the other team, with no blocking or jumping preventing the damage.


WINNING
=======

The team with no white markers left at the end of a turn loses, the other team wins.
