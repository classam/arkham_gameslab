### Positive ###
* Nothin'

### Negative ###
* It feels like, no matter how well you lay your plans out, by your next turn they will collapse. 
* There's a certain amount of AP in deciding your move. 
* The game is very much more about ruining the combinations of other players rather than building your own combinations. 
* Winning becomes a matter of being the player with the weakest opposition to your left and the best luck.
