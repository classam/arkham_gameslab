Rules:
------ 

Arrange the dice, in repeating Red/Blue/Green/Yellow, in a square, like this: 

       G  Y  B  R
     R            G
     B            Y
     Y            B
     G            R
       R  B  G  Y

Each player gets a side of the board.

Roll the dice.  

Moving
======

1. Swap two adjacent die. 

       G  Y  B  R
     R            G
     B            Y
     Y            B
     G            R
       R  B<>G  Y

       G  Y  B  R
     R            G
     B            Y
     Y            B
     G            R
       R  B  G  Y<^

2. Swap two opposing die. 

       G  Y  B  R
     R    |       G
     B    |       Y
     Y    |       B
     G    |       R
       R  B  G  Y

3. Swap two die of the same color.

       G  Y  B  R
     R       |    G
     B       |    Y
     Y    |       B
     G    |       R
       R  B  G  Y

Starting from the first player and proceeding to the left, each player gets one move. This is Round 0. 

Then, starting from the first player and proceeding to the left, each player gets one TURN.  This is Round 1. 

The game lasts until the end of Round 4. 

Turn
====
Each turn: 
1. The player may either SCORE or MOVE. 
2. The player must MOVE. 

Scoring
=======

The scoring player scores only dice along his side of the board. The listed scores only apply to adjacent die: 

<table> 
    <tr><td>Two-of-a-kind (pair)</td> <td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Two die of the same color</td> <td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Three-of-a-kind</td> <td>3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Three die of the same color</td> <td>3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Four-of-a-kind</td> <td>7</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Four die of the same color</td> <td>7</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Run of four</td> <td>7</td></tr>
</table> 

It is possible to score multiple times and combinations - a pair of blue die is worth 2 points, for example.

However, a larger combination always swallows a smaller one - a four-of-a-kind is worth 7 points, not 7+3+3+1+1+1=16 points. 

After scoring any X-of-a-kind or run, the player must re-roll any die used to achieve that score. 

After scoring any die of the same color, the player to the scoring player's right may rearrange the entire board of the scoring player.
