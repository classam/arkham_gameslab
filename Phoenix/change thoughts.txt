PRIORITY:

What is the victory condition?
	- VP gathering?
	- each race has different victory conditions?
	- victory condition deck?
	- I want multiple ways to win.
	
"Player losing their home star cannot produce more ships"
	- need better penalty than this...this is to harsh.
	- can produce at another star that has a human population
	- can't win the game
		- can't get "VP"s?
	- Idea from another page: If your home star is captured, the conquering player immediately gains your Class 2, 4, and 5 Technology, which you also retain. 
		Any Class 3 Technologies you have the conqueror may acquire at half cost (rounding up). 
	- your fleets must all return to your Home Star and the capturing fleet is immediately warped to one sector away, of their choice
		
Race/ability fluff

MAYBE:
	
Some way for person to defend an incoming fleet? Or is it necessary? 
	- person sends massive fleet to attack. 
	- Perfect Play: everyone has the same number of ships until some are destroyed through combat
		- that means a massive fleet would have left other planets undefended
			- which means there are an unequal swap for the massive fleet
		- whack-a-mole planet swapping is ok I think
	- so should keep the production separate from actions
		- you produce ships regardless of what else you do
		
Lack of "front line defense"?
	- there is no way to create a defensive border to hold against
	- I like this because the defensive borders create static situations that I don't like.
	- However it is slightly unnerving to have a planet taken by an opponent that easily.
	
Technology research/customization is fun! 
	- But can get out of hand quickly.
	- Currently no design space for this kind of customization.

Alliances
	- Players may conference with each other in secret at any time.
	- Two or more players' fleets may orbit the same star peacefully. Any fleet may attack any other on their respective players' turns.
	- Two or more players' fleets may share the same warp, merging their fleets into one for the journey. The player who owns the warp being used decides when and where to arrive. Fleets may attack each other while in warp. If the passenger fleet destroys the warp-owning fleet, it is immediately flung out of warp and arrives at an eligible star of the warp-owner's choosing. 

- This person wrote a lot of rules about technologies and such.

DESIGN THOUGHTS:
- need to encourage back and forth play - it's ok to lose a system
- need to encourage loss of ships - no cold wars
- needs to play in an hour
- try production every other turn...I kind of want production to be linked to something else though.
- turns have to be quick
- 24 possible ships per turn. At best, 6 per player. Start with 15.



GARBAGED THOUGHTS (but could still be recycled...):
- defender loses half their ships, attacker loses that many - 1
- possible dice rolling addition, but I don't like it: roll for every ship, add up total, bigger fleet destroys smaller fleet
- combat cards could have "kill 1 ship" "defend 1 ship" on them, ala GoT
- Combat cards - a deck of cards drawn before each combat to affect it?
		- friendly fire
		- asteroid fields
		- space creature
		- tall planetary gravity well
		- ability for attacker to retreat after winning?
	- These feel a little unnecessary. But I would like to have "special things" to modify combat.



WRITTEN ALREADY:

Needs more warp tokens?
	- unlimited, or some larger limited number?
		- limited number means you need to have one available for retreating fleets
	- Should be able to have more than 2 fleets in warp at once.
	- This would encourage smaller fleets.
	- Makes motion more easy
		- which will make taking a planet easier
		- which puts more emphasis on defense?
	- "one departure of any kind per turn"? That sounds not useful.
		- coordination of attacking fleets is unnecessarily cumbersome
	- start warp tokens at "0". Count your warp movement starting just outside of your starting system.
	
Needs new combat mechanics badly
	- use Game of Thrones cards for combat?
		- provides bluffing and potentially special abilities
		- cycle through cards as in GoT
	- retreating fleets must be put onto a warp token. If you don't have any the fleet is destroyed.
	- should be allowed to retreat fleet, but with a penalty. Maybe draw another combat card?
	- attacker chooses how many ships to kill, and they also lose that many -1.
	
- Combat cards abilities:
	- something "throw away" for fleets that are definitely going to lose
	- support abilities for near by fleets and/or planets/production
	- prevent something good/bad from happening
	- Ignore your opponents strength/text ability
	- "If you win this battle"/"If you lose this battle"
	- Increase power of each ship in fleet
	- cards with just strength on them as well
