Needs new combat mechanics badly
	- use Game of Thrones cards for combat?
		- provides bluffing and potentially special abilities
		- need to have abilities that are for:
			- fleets that are definitely going to lose
			- support abilities for near by fleets and/or planets/production
		- cycle through cards as in GoT
	- retreating fleets must be put onto a warp token. If you don't have any the fleet is destroyed.
	- should be allowed to retreat fleet, but with a penalty. Maybe draw another combat card?
	1. ***attacker chooses how many ships to kill, and they also lose that many -1.
	2. defender loses half their ships, attacker loses that many - 1
	3. attacker chooses how many ships defender loses. Attacker then loses
	4. possible dice rolling addition, but I don't like it.
		- roll for every ship, add up total, bigger fleet destroys smaller fleet

Some way for person to defend an incoming fleet? Or is it necessary? 
	- person sends massive fleet to attack. 
	- Perfect Play: everyone has the same number of ships until some are destroyed through combat
		- that means a massive fleet would have left other planets undefended
			- which means there are an unequal swap for the massive fleet
		- whack-a-mole planet swapping is ok I think
	- so should keep the production separate from actions
		- you produce ships regardless of what else you do
		
Lack of "front line defense"?
	- there is no way to create a defensive border to hold against
	- I like this because the defensive borders create static situations that I don't like.
	- However it is slightly unnerving to have a planet taken by an opponent that easily.

What is the victory condition? If it's "take home system" or "win all systems", it's bad.
	- VP gathering?
	- each race has different victory conditions?
	- victory condition deck? <--

Needs more warp tokens?
	- unlimited, or some larger limited number?
		- limited number means you need to have one available for retreating fleets
	- Should be able to have more than 2 fleets in warp at once.
	- This would encourage smaller fleets.
	- Makes motion more easy
		- which will make taking a planet easier
		- which puts more emphasis on defense?
	- "one departure of any kind per turn"? That sounds not useful.
		- coordination of attacking fleets is unnecessarily cumbersome
	
"Player losing their home star cannot produce more ships"
	- need better penalty than this...this is to harsh.

Combat cards - a deck of cards drawn before each combat to affect it?
		- friendly fire
		- asteroid fields
		- space creature
		- tall planetary gravity well
		
		- ability for attacker to retreat after winning?
		

Random Thoughts:
- need to encourage back and forth play - it's ok to lose a system
- need to encourage loss of ships - no cold wars
- needs to play in an hour
- try production every other turn...I kind of want production to be linked to something else though.
- turns have to be quick
