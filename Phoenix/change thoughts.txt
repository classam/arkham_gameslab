PRIORITY:
- home star tokens/flags

	
MAYBE:
	
Some way for person to defend an incoming fleet? Or is it necessary? 
	- person sends massive fleet to attack. 
	- Perfect Play: everyone has the same number of ships until some are destroyed through combat
		- that means a massive fleet would have left other planets undefended
			- which means there are an unequal swap for the massive fleet
		- whack-a-mole planet swapping is ok I think
	- so should keep the production separate from actions
		- you produce ships regardless of what else you do
		
Lack of "front line defense"?
	- there is no way to create a defensive border to hold against
	- I like this because the defensive borders create static situations that I don't like.
	- However it is slightly unnerving to have a planet taken by an opponent that easily.
	
Technology research/customization is fun! 
	- But can get out of hand quickly.
	- Currently no design space for this kind of customization.

Alliances
	- Players may conference with each other in secret at any time.
	- Two or more players' fleets may orbit the same star peacefully. Any fleet may attack any other on their respective players' turns.
	- Two or more players' fleets may share the same warp, merging their fleets into one for the journey. The player who owns the warp being used decides when and where to arrive. Fleets may attack each other while in warp. If the passenger fleet destroys the warp-owning fleet, it is immediately flung out of warp and arrives at an eligible star of the warp-owner's choosing. 

- This person wrote a lot of rules about technologies and such.

- try production every other turn...I kind of want production to be linked to something else though.
- 24 possible ships per turn. At best, 6 per player. Start with 15.



CARD PROBABILITIES

first card can be any at all 8/8
second card must match first card 1/8
drawing 7 cards

8/8 * 1/8 draw 7 = 0.875 * 7 = 6.12500 cards matching

draw from 10 cards instead
10/10 * 1/10 draw 7 * 7 = 4.9 cards matching

120/120 * 1/120 draw 7 = 0.0583333 * 7 = 0.4083331, 0 cards matching

X * 7 * 7 = # of matching cards

2 matching cards
X = 0.0408163266
4 / 98 = 0.0408163265 = 2 / 49 = 1/24.5

with 20 cards	(7 / 20) * 7 = 2.45 cards matching
with 24 cards  	(7 / 24) * 7 = 2.04166667 cards matching
with 25 cards	(7 / 25) * 7 = 1.96 cards matching



GARBAGED THOUGHTS (but could still be recycled...):
- defender loses half their ships, attacker loses that many - 1
- possible dice rolling addition, but I don't like it: roll for every ship, add up total, bigger fleet destroys smaller fleet
- Combat cards - a deck of cards drawn before each combat to affect it?
		- friendly fire
		- asteroid fields
		- space creature
		- tall planetary gravity well
		- ability for attacker to retreat after winning?
	- These feel a little unnecessary. But I would like to have "special things" to modify combat.
- each race has different victory conditions?
- VP gathering?
- victory condition deck?
- Idea from another page: If your home star is captured, the conquering player immediately gains your Class 2, 4, and 5 Technology, which you also retain. 
	Any Class 3 Technologies you have the conqueror may acquire at half cost (rounding up). 
- your fleets must all return to your Home Star and the capturing fleet is immediately warped to one sector away, of their choice
