THE BOARD

The game board has 24 lettered sectors - 4 sectors long by 3 sectors wide by 2 sectors deep. The 12 sectors containing yellow stars are considered to be above the 12 sectors containing red stars. ie. sector A-yellow is directly above and adjacent to sector A-red.

Each sector contains 2 stars. A star may contain resources for use in production.
	- stars with a O have human population
	- stars with a + have raw materials

There are 4 Home Stars. these are where each player begins the game and also where new ships are built.	

	Algol (sector A-yellow)
	Pavo (sector J-red)
	Regulus (sector C-yellow)
	Antares (sector L-red)

There are four hyperspace tracks. These are used to indicate how far your fleet has travelled in hyperspace. They don't indicate a direction of travel or a destination, only how many sectors that fleet is allowed to move from it's departure sector.



THE PIECES

Small pieces are 1 starship, large pieces are 5 starships. There are an unlimited number of starships available.

The warp tokens carry fleets as they move along the hyperspace track, and shows the letter and colour of the fleets departure sector. There are a maximum of 4 warp tokens for each player.



THE COMBAT CARDS

Each player has 7 combat cards. These represent admirals and captains of your fleets and are used to modify combat strength as well as provide special abilities during combat. 

Any player may examine any other players hand at any time, except for the time period between when a card has been selected during combat and when it is resolved. Ie, you may look at someone's hand, except when by doing so you could exactly determine which card they have selected.

After you play your last card, immediately re-draw every card previously played except for the very last one. In this way, you never run out of cards.



THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES/WINNING THE GAME

These cards are placed face up on the table. They have tasks on them that each player must work towards in order to win the game.

After each player has had a turn, check the Strategic Objectives. If any player has claimed at least 2 Objectives and has more than any of their opponents, that player wins.



GAME SETUP

Each player chooses a colour. Take 15 ships and place them around your Home Star. Give each player a set of 7 Combat Cards.

Place all of the Strategic Objective cards face up on the table.

If playing with 3 players, use Home Stars Regulus and Antares, but make Mira (D-red) the third Home Star. Algol and Pavo become normal non-Home Stars.
If playing with 2 players, use Home Stars Algol and Antares. Pavo and Regulus become normal non-Home Stars.



GAME TURN

On your turn:

1. If it is a production turn, produce ships. 
2. Move all warp tokens a single square forward.
3. Perform all departures using available warp tokens.
4. Any number of warp tokens may arrive at a destination star.
5. Perform any battles.
6. Claim strategic objectives.

The turn moves around the board clockwise. After every player has had a turn, check to see if any player has won. Check this again after every complete cycle of players.



PRODUCING

New ships are produced on every second turn. New ships may only be produced at your starting Home Star.

Count the number of +, O pairs on planets that you possess. For each complete pair, you produce 1 ship.



MOVING WARP TOKENS

Move all warp tokens a single square forward. Any warp tokens that move past the last warp square are lost in space and are destroyed.



DEPARTURES

Take any number of ships around a star and place them on a warp token. Put a red or yellow peg into the lettered whole on that warp token, denoting the departure sector. Place the warp token on the entry space on the hyperspace track.

If the departure star and arrival star are both in the same sector, the journey happens immediately, but still uses a warp token for the turn.



ARRIVALS

Start at the departure sector - this is "0". Count sectors until you reach (and include) the destination sector.

	- Count to adjacent sectors. You may not move diagonally.
	- You may never make more than one horizontal and one vertical turn.
	- You may not backtrack.

Your warp token must be at the number on the hyperspace track corresponding to this count of sectors.

Take the ships from the warp token and place them on a single star in that sector. All ships from a single warp token must travel to the same star. 



COMBAT

If your ships occupy a star also occupied by an enemy, a battle will occur. A battle is performed in a sequence of 6 steps. Each set of steps is a round. Each step is a phase.

1. Count total fleet sizes
2. Select and resolve combat cards
3. Determine victor
4. Resolve losses
5. Retreats
6. Fight again

The Defender is the fleet that occupied the star at the start of the turn. Every other fleet is the Attacker.

COUNT FLEET SIZES

You and your opponent count the number of ships on each of your sides. Include all fleets that have arrived at this star this turn. This count is your Fleet Strength.

SELECT COMBAT CARDS

You and your opponent each select a combat card from your hand. This selection is secret.

Reveal your combat card selections at the same time and then resolve any text abilities, with the attacker resolving first.

DETERMINE VICTOR

Add your Fleet Strength to the Strength of your combat card. The player with the higher total is the victor of this combat.

RESOLVE LOSSES

The victor of the combat chooses a number between 0 and the number of ships in the losers fleet. The loser of the combat loses this many ships. The victor of the combat loses this many ships minus 1.

RETREATS

The loser chooses whether to retreat any number of ships from their fleet. If there are no enemy ships remaining, the victor may choose to retreat any number of ships from their fleet after the loser has chosen.

Combat cards are discarded.

Each retreating fleet is put onto a warp token and placed on the hyperspace path at the entry space. If the player has no warp tokens, they may not choose to retreat. A player may not retreat their fleet to another star in the same system.

FIGHT AGAIN

If there are ships from enemy fleets still occupying a star, start a new combat round again from the beginning.



CLAIM STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

Check if you have completed any of the Strategic Objectives this turn. If you have, put one of your ship tokens onto the card for that Objective.



OCCUPATION

You occupy a star so long as you have a single ship around that star. If you move the ship, you lose occupation of the star.

Your Home Star is an exception. You occupy this even if you have no ships around it, but only if no opponent occupies it.



LOSS OF A HOME STAR

If you do not occupy your Home Star you may not claim Strategic Objectives. If you do not occupy your Home Star, you may produce at another planet you occupy that contains both a + and a O resource.
