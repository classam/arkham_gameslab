THE BOARD

The game board has 24 lettered sectors - 4 sectors long by 3 sectors wide by 2 sectors deep. The 12 sectors containing yellow stars are considered to be above the 12 sectors containing red stars. ie. sector A-yellow is directly above and adjacent to sector A-red.

Each sector contains 2 stars. A star may contain resources for use in production.
	- stars with a O have human population
	- stars with a + have raw materials

There are 4 Home Stars. these are where each player begins the game and also where new ships are built.	

	Algol (sector A-yellow)
	Pavo (sector J-red)
	Regulus (sector C-yellow)
	Antares (sector L-red)

There are four hyperspace tracks numbered from 1 to 6. These are used to indicate how far your fleet has travelled in hyperspace. They don't indicate a direction of travel or a destination, only how many sectors that fleet is allowed to move from it's departure sector.



THE PIECES

Pieces are 1 starship. There are an unlimited number of starships available.



THE PRODUCTION CARD

This double-sided card is used to indicate whether or not the current turn is a production turn.



THE SECTOR CARDS

The sector cards are used to indicate which sector a fleet has departed from. They have a letter - A through L - and are double sided with one side being Red and one side being Yellow. 



THE LEADER CARDS

Each player has a deck of leader cards, which they will draw 7 from for the game. These represent leaders of your fleets and are used to modify combat strength as well as provide special abilities. 

After you play your last card, immediately re-draw every card previously discarded except for the very last one. In this way, you never run out of cards.

Some leader cards have "Use" abilities. These are played from your hand at any time. Place them on the table face-up. They are not discarded - do not re-draw them when you run out of cards.



THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE CARDS

During play these cards will be placed face-up on the table. On them are tasks that players must complete in order to win the game. Each objective may be completed by multiple players.



WINNING THE GAME

A player wins the game when he or she claims 3 Strategic Objectives.



GAME SETUP

Each player chooses a colour. Take 15 ships and place them around your Home Star. Each player shuffles their Leader deck and draws 7 cards from it. Set the rest of the deck aside, it is not used again.

Shuffle the Objective deck and deal 1 card to each player. Deal 1 card face-up on the table.

If playing with 3 players, use Home Stars Regulus and Antares, but make Mira (D-red) the third Home Star. Algol and Pavo become normal non-Home Stars.
If playing with 2 players, use Home Stars Algol and Antares. Pavo and Regulus become normal non-Home Stars.



GAME TURN

On your turn:

1. If it is a production turn, produce ships. 
2. Move all fleets a single square forward.
3. Perform all departures.
4. Any number of fleets may arrive at a destination star.
5. Perform any combats.
6. Claim strategic objectives.

The turn moves around the board clockwise. After every player has had a turn, check to see if any player has won. Check this again after every complete cycle of players.



PRODUCING

New ships are produced on every second turn. New ships may produced at any star you occupy that has both a + and a O resource.

Count the number of +, O pairs on stars that you possess. For each complete pair, you produce 1 ship.



MOVING WARP TOKENS

Move all fleets a single square forward. 

Any fleets that move past the last warp square are Lost in Hyperspace and are destroyed. A Leader assigned to a fleet that is Lost in Hyperspace is removed from the game. Take a Lost in Hyperspace card. This card can be used at any time to give the ability on the removed leader card.



DEPARTURES

Take any number of ships around a star and place them on the hyperspace entry space. This is a fleet. Fleets are grouped and may not split up or group up with another fleet.

You may never have more than 4 fleets in warp at once.

You may assign one of your leaders to a departing fleet. Place the card face-down under the fleet. That leader may not leave the fleet while it is in warp.

If the departure star and arrival star are both in the same sector, the journey happens immediately, but still uses one of your maximum warps for the turn.



ARRIVALS

Start at the departure sector - this is "0". Count sectors until you reach (and include) the destination sector.

	- Count to adjacent sectors. You may not move diagonally.
	- You may never make more than one horizontal and one vertical turn.
	- You may not backtrack.

Your fleet must be at the number on the hyperspace track corresponding to this count of sectors.

Take all of the ships from the hyperspace square you are arriving from and place them on a single star in that sector. All ships in a single fleet must travel to the same star. 

If there is a leader in the fleet, and no combat occurs, take the leader card and put it back into your hand.



COMBAT

If your ships occupy a star also occupied by an enemy, a combat will occur. A combat is performed in a sequence of 6 phases. Each set of phases is a combat round.

1. Count total fleet sizes
2. Resolve leader cards
3. Determine victor
4. Resolve losses
5. Retreats
6. Fight again

The Defender is the fleet that occupied the star at the start of the turn. Every other fleet is the Attacker.

If a player is Defender in multiple combats in a single turn, that player chooses the order to resolve each combat in.

COUNT FLEET SIZES

You and your opponent count the number of ships on each of your sides. Include all fleets that have arrived at this star this turn. This count is your Fleet Strength.

RESOLVE LEADER CARDS

The Defender may select a leader card from their hand to be used in the combat round. If the Attacker had a leader assigned to their fleet, that leader's strength and text ability is used in this combat round. The Attacker may not use a leader card from their hand.

Reveal your leader cards at the same time and then resolve any text abilities, with the Attacker resolving first.

DETERMINE VICTOR

Add your Fleet Strength to the Strength of your leader card. The player with the higher total is the victor of this combat.

If there is a tie, there is no victor for this round. 

RESOLVE LOSSES

The victor of the combat chooses a number between 0 and the number of ships in the losers fleet. The loser of the combat loses this many ships. The victor of the combat loses this many ships minus 1.

WITHDRAWAL

The loser chooses whether to withdraw any number of ships from their fleet. If there are no enemy ships remaining, the victor may choose to withdraw any number of ships from their fleet after the loser has chosen.

If the round was a tie, the defender chooses first whether to withdraw or not.

Leader cards used this round are discarded.

Each withdrawing fleet departs, as per the normal rules. If the player already has their maximum number of fleets in hyperspace, they may not retreat. A player may not withdraw their fleet to another star in the same system.

FIGHT AGAIN

If there are ships from enemy fleets still occupying a star, start a new combat round again from the beginning.

If there are no ships remaining from enemy fleets, the combat is completed.



CLAIM STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

Claim Strategic Objectives by completing the task on the card, and then placing one of your ship tokens on it.

If you have completed the Strategic Objective in your hand, place it face-up on the table and claim it. Any player may claim this Objective on his or her turn, in addition to any others already on the table. Draw a new Objective into your hand.



OCCUPATION

You occupy a star so long as you have a single ship around that star.

Your Home Star is an exception. You occupy this even if you have no ships around it, but only if no opponent occupies it.



LOSS OF A HOME STAR

If you do not occupy your Home Star you may not claim Strategic Objectives.
