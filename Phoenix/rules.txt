THE BOARD

The game board has 24 lettered sectors - 4 sectors long by 3 sectors wide by 2 sectors deep. The 12 sectors containing yellow stars are considered to be above the 12 sectors containing red stars. ie. sector A-yellow is directly above sector A-red.

Each sector contains 2 stars. A star may contain resources for use in production.
	- stars with a O have human population
	- stars with a + have raw materials

There are 4 Home Stars. these are where each player begins the game and also where new ships are built.	

	Algol (sector A-yellow)
	Pavo (sector J-red)
	Regulus (sector C-yellow)
	Antares (sector L-red)

There are four hyperspace track. When making a journey, these are used to indicate how far your fleet has travel. But they don't indicate a direction of travel nor a destination, only how far that fleet is allowed to move.



THE PIECES

Small pieces are 1 starship, large pieces are 5 starships. There are an unlimited number of starships available.

The warp tokens carry fleets as they move along the hyperspace track, and shows the letter and colour of the fleets departure sector. There are a maximum of 5 warp tokens for each player.



GAME SETUP

Each player chooses a colour. Take 15 ships and place them around your Home Star.

If playing with 3 players, use Home Stars Regulus and Antares, but make Mira (D-red) the third Home Star. Algol and Pavo become normal non-Home Stars.
If playing with 2 players, use Home Stars Algol and Antares. Pavo and Regulus become normal non-Home Stars.



GAME TURN

On your turn:

1. If it is a production turn, produce ships. 
2. Move all warp tokens a single square forward.
3. Perform all departures using available warp tokens.
4. Any number of warp tokens may arrive at a destination star.
5. Perform any battles.

The turn moves around the board clockwise.



PRODUCING

New ships are produced on every second turn. New ships may only be produced at your starting Home Star.

Count the number of +, O pairs on planets that you possess. For each complete pair, you produce 1 ship.



MOVING WARP TOKENS

Move all warp tokens a single square forward. Any warp tokens that move past the last warp square are lost in space and are destroyed.



ARRIVALS

Start at the departure sector - this is "0". Count sectors until you reach (and include) the destination sector.

	- Count to adjacent sectors. You may not move diagonally.
	- You may never make more than one horizontal and one vertical turn.
	- You may not backtrack.

Your warp token must be at the number on the hyperspace track corresponding to this count of sectors.

Take the ships from the warp token and place them on a single star in that sector. All ships from a single warp token must travel to the same star. 



DEPARTURES

Take any number of ships around a star and place them on a warp token. Put a red or yellow peg into the lettered whole on that warp token, denoting the departure sector. Place the warp token on the entry space on the hyperspace track.

If the departure star and arrival star are both in the same sector, the journey happens immediately, but still uses a warp token for the turn.



BATTLE

If your ships occupy a star also occupied by an enemy, a battle will occur.

OCCUPATION

You occupy a star so long as you have a single ship around that star. If you move the ship, you lose occupation of the star.

Your Home Star is an exception, which you occupy even if you have no ships around it.
