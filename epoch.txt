EPOCH ELLIPSE 
*************
The end has come and gone.  After a century of infinite growth, everything has come full circle.

There is no food. There is no power. The few people who are left squabble over scraps.  

And a small group of survivors band together to take back what is left of their city.

WIN/LOSE
********

This is a limited co-operative game.  Each player wins by surviving to the end.  This is best accomplished by working with others. 

The game ends if all players have Recovered 10VP worth of Locations. 
All players lose if no Survivors remain alive. 

GAME START
**********

* Players start with a deck containing - 

4 bullets ( SALVAGE - WEAPON ) 
4 tinned ham ( SALVAGE - FOOD)
1 SURVIVOR card
1 mild injury ( CATASTROPHE - COLLAPSE )

* The "Graveyard" and "Apartment Building" Locations are put into play. 


TRASH VS. DISCARD
*****************
* Trashed cards are placed on the top of the Graveyard's Event Deck. 
* Discarded cards are placed in the player's discard pile. They remain a part of the player's deck. 


PHASES
******

* A game day consists of 5 phases: 

1. WAKE UP
2. PLAN
3. EXPLORE
4. HUNGER
5. REST

1. WAKE UP
* Each Player draws 5 cards from her Survivor's deck.
    - If the deck has less than five cards, tough beans. 
* Cards are not private, and any player may see any other player's cards. 
* Players without Survivor Decks are Mournful Sacrifices for the turn. 
    - Mournful Sacrifices draw 1 card from the Salvage Deck at the beginning of the turn. 
    - They may resolve and play this card at any time during the turn, on behalf of any player. 

2. PLAN
* Players may exchange Salvage Cards with one another. 
* Trades must be 1-for-1. 
* Only one trade may take place between any set of 2 players in a turn. 
    - example: In a game containing Alice, Bob, and Carl...
        - Alice can trade with Bob, once
        - Alice can trade with Carl, once
        - Carl can trade with Bob, once
* Survivor Cards and Catastrophe Cards may not be traded.
* For each point of Medical care that the player can produce through discarding or trashing Salvage Cards, that player may Trash 1 Catastrophe Card from her hand. 

3. EXPLORE
* In the explore phase, each player must either: 
    - Explore a NEW LOCATION, alone
    or
    - Explore an already EXPLORED LOCATION, alone.
* If one player explores a NEW LOCATION, any player who has not yet explored a location that turn may treat that location as an EXPLORED LOCATION.
* If two players wish to explore the same Location in a turn, they must decide in which order they plan to explore the Location, and proceed one at a time.  

3A. NEW LOCATION
    - Draw a Location from the Location Deck.
    - Draw as many cards from each Deck as are listed on the Location card, shuffle them together, and create a deck with them.
        - Place this deck face-down next to the upturned Location card. We shall refer to this as the "Event Deck"
    - Example: 
        LOCATION: Mall
            Catastrophe: 7
            Salvage: 4
            Survivors: 1
            VP: 1
        - In this case, we would draw 
            - 7 cards from the Catastrophe Deck, 
            - 4 cards from the Salvage Deck, and 
            - 1 card from the Survivors Deck, 
            - shuffle them together to make the Mall's Event Deck, and place them face down next to the Mall card. 
    - For each card from the Catastrophe Deck that has been placed in the Event Deck, place a Catastrophe Token on the Location Card. 
    - Then, the player draws and resolves the top card from the newly created Event Deck. 

3B. EXPLORED LOCATION
    - Shuffle the explored location's Event Deck. 
    - Draw 1-6 cards, face-down, from the top of the explored location's Event Deck.
        - This set of cards is the current Exploration. 
    - Flip all of the cards in the Exploration at the same time. 
    - First, the player resolves all of the Catastrophe Cards. 
    - Then the player resolves all of the Survivor Cards.
    - Then the player resolves all of the Salvage Cards.

3C. RESOLVING CATASTROPHE CARDS
    - A Catastrophe Card might be a FIGHT, an INJURY, or a JINX 
    - COMBAT
        - Someone or something wants to make the player dead. Play WEAPON cards to make this not happen. 
    - COLLAPSE
        - The player has managed to injure herself. Play MEDICAL cards to make this not happen. 
    - CURSE
        - A one-time negative effect happens. Resolve the effects of the card. 

    - Any catastrophe that a player does not avoid immediately goes into the player's discard pile. 
    - If a player dies during an Exploration, all remaining Catastrophe, Survivor, and Salvage cards from the Exploration are returned to the Location's Event Deck.

    - For every Catastrophe Card removed from the Location's Event Deck, remove a Catastrophe Token from the Location. 
    - Correspondingly, for every Catastrophe Card added to the Location's Event Deck, add a Catastrophe Token to the Location.
        - The number of Catastrophe Tokens should always be equal to the number of Catastrophe Cards in the deck.  


3D. RESOLVING SURVIVOR CARDS
    - The player has found a Survivor in the wreckage! 
    - The player may give the Survivor any Salvage cards from her hand or any Salvage cards from the current Exploration. 
        - The player places any cards that he will give to the Survivor face down. 
        - Then, the player places the Survivor Card face-up on top of the pile, and sets this pile aside. 
            - Should any player die, this Survivor and deck will replace them. 

3E. RESOLVING SALVAGE CARDS
    - Take any remaining salvage cards and add them to your hand. 
    - Salvage Cards may be FOOD cards, WEAPON cards, MEDICAL cards, ALLY cards, or CHARM cards. 
    - FOOD 
        - These cards prevent you from starving. 
    - WEAPON
        - These cards help you fight off Catastrophes.
    - MEDICAL 
        - These cards help prevent injuries and shed Catastrophes from your deck. 
    - ALLY 
        - These cards provide miscellaneous positive effects. 
    - CHARM
        - A one-time positive effect happens. Resolve the effects of the card, then discard it. 
    - A player may not have more than 5 cards in hand.  Any cards over the limit are returned to the Location's Event Deck, face down. 

3F. RECOVERING LOCATIONS
    - If a Location card is ever cleared of Catastrophe Tokens, it has been Recovered! 
    - If a Location card that is cleared of Catastrophe Tokens gains another Catastrophe Card (and Token), it is no longer Recovered. 
    - A Location is worth a certain amount of Victory Points.
    - If 10 Victory Points worth of Locations are Recovered at the same time, the game is won. 

3G. EMERGENCY STABILIZATION
* For each point of Medical care that the player can produce through discarding or trashing Salvage Cards, that player may move 1 Catastrophe card from her discard pile to her deck. . 

4. HUNGER
* In this phase, each player must produce at least one point of "Food" from a Salvage Card or take a card from the Catastrophe deck and place it immediately in their discard pile. 

5. REST
* In this phase, one player takes the top card from the Night Deck and resolves it. 
* After that, all players discard all cards remaining in their hands. 
* The player now shuffles his discard pile with his existing deck to create a new deck. 
* If a Mournful Sacrifice player still has his one Salvage card by the end of the turn, it is Trashed. 


DEATH
*****
* If a player's discard pile ever contains 3 Catastrophe cards, that player's turn ends immediately and her current Survivor dies. This is bad. 
* Should a player die, he immediately places his hand and deck into his discard pile.
* This discard pile is placed face-down on the Graveyard location. 
* The Graveyard location can be explored like any other location. 
    - However, a Recovered Graveyard is worth 0 Victory Points, and 
    - Survivors found in the Graveyard are not added to the Survivor pool. They are dead.
        - Instead, draw and resolve the top card from the Catastrophe deck. 
* In the next WAKE UP phase, if there are Survivors who are not in play, the player chooses from one of the Survivor placed aside earlier. 
    - The player takes this deck, adds 2 cards from the Salvage Deck, the Survivor Card, and shuffles them all together to make a new deck.
    - The player then starts the WAKE UP phase as normal. 
    - This occurs in the order that the players have died. 
        - Example: 
            - In Round 3, Alice's Survivor dies while exploring the Empty Skyscraper. 
            - Then, Bob's Survivor dies of starvation in the Hunger phase. 
            - Finally, Carl's Survivor bleeds out in his sleep in the Rest phase. 
            - At the beginning of Round 4, Alice gets first pick of the Survivors. 
            - Bob gets second pick.
            - That's all the Survivors that are left. Carl gets nothing. 
            - In Round 4, Bob finds a Survivor in the Empty Skyscraper. 
            - At the beginning of Round 5, Carl gets the newly found Subscriber. 


COMBAT
******
* Catastrophe - Combat cards are events where your character has to fight to proceed. 
* A Combat card will have a Difficulty rating.
* In order to win the combat, the player must produce at least this many points from Salvage - Weapon cards. 
* If the Combat is won, the Catastrophe is placed in the Graveyard. 
* If the Combat is lost, the Catastrophe is placed in the player's discard pile.
