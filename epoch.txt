* The "Graveyard" and "Apartment Building" Locations are put into play.


TRASH VS. DISCARD
*****************
* Trashed cards are placed in the Graveyard. 
* Discarded cards are placed in the player's discard pile. They remain a part of the player's deck. 


PHASES
******

* A game day consists of 5 phases: 

1. WAKE UP
2. PLAN
3. EXPLORE
4. HUNGER
5. REST

1. WAKE UP
* Each Player draws 5 cards from her Survivor's deck.
    - If the deck has less than five cards, tough beans. 
* Cards are not private, and any player may see any other player's cards. 
* Players without Survivor Decks are Mournful Sacrifices for the turn. 
    - Mournful Sacrifices draw 1 card from the Salvage Deck at the beginning of the turn. 
    - They may resolve and play this card at any time during the turn, on behalf of any player. 

2. PLAN
* Players may exchange Salvage Cards with one another. 
* Trades must be 1-for-1. 
* Only one trade may take place between any set of 2 players in a turn. 
    - example: In a game containing Alice, Bob, and Carl...
        - Alice can trade with Bob, once
        - Alice can trade with Carl, once
        - Carl can trade with Bob, once
* Survivor Cards and Injury Cards may not be traded. 

3. EXPLORE
* In the explore phase, each player must either: 
    - Explore a NEW LOCATION, alone
    or
    - Explore an already EXPLORED LOCATION, alone.
* If one player explores a NEW LOCATION, any player who has not yet explored a location that turn may treat that location as an EXPLORED LOCATION.
* If two players wish to explore the same Location in a turn, they must decide in which order they plan to explore the Location, and proceed one at a time.  

3A. NEW LOCATION
    - Draw a Location from the Location Deck.
    - Draw as many cards from each Deck as are listed on the Location card, shuffle them together, and create a deck with them.
        - Place this deck face-down next to the upturned Location card. We shall refer to this as the "Event Deck"
    - Example: 
        LOCATION: Mall
            Catastrophe: 7
            Salvage: 4
            Survivors: 1
            VP: 1
        - In this case, we would draw 
            - 7 cards from the Catastrophe Deck, 
            - 4 cards from the Salvage Deck, and 
            - 1 card from the Survivors Deck, 
            - shuffle them together to make the Mall's Event Deck, and place them face down next to the Mall card. 
    - For each card from the Catastrophe Deck that has been placed in the Event Deck, place a Catastrophe Token on the Location Card. 
    - Then, the player draws and resolves the top card from the newly created Event Deck. 

3B. EXPLORED LOCATION
    - Shuffle the explored location's Event Deck. 
    - Draw 1-4 cards, face-down from the top of the explored location's Event Deck.
        - This set of cards is the current Exploration. 
    - Flip all of the cards in the Exploration at the same time. 
    - First, the player resolves all of the Catastrophe Cards. 
    - Then the player resolves all of the Survivor Cards.
    - Then the player resolves all of the Salvage Cards.

3C. RESOLVING CATASTROPHE CARDS
    - A Catastrophe Card might be a FIGHT, an INJURY, or a JINX 
    - FIGHT
        - Someone or something wants to make the player dead. Play WEAPON cards to make this not happen. 
    - INJURY
        - The player has managed to injure herself. Play MEDICAL cards to make this not happen. 
    - JINX
        - A one-time negative effect happens. Resolve the effects of the card. 

    - Any catastrophe that a player does not avoid immediately goes into the player's discard pile. 
    - If a player's discard pile ever contains 3 Catastrophe cards, that player's turn ends immediately and her current Survivor dies. This is bad. 
        - If a player dies during an Exploration, all remaining Catastrophe, Survivor, and Salvage cards from the Exploration are returned to the Location's Event Deck.

    - For every Catastrophe Card removed from the Location's Event Deck, remove a Catastrophe Token from the Location. 
    - Correspondingly, for every Catastrophe Card added to the Location's Event Deck, add a Catastrophe Token to the Location.
        - The number of Catastrophe Tokens should always be equal to the number of Catastrophe Cards in the deck.  


3D. RESOLVING SURVIVOR CARDS
    - The player has found a Survivor in the wreckage! 
    - The player may give the Survivor any Salvage cards from her hand or any Salvage cards from the current Exploration. 
        - The player places any cards that he will give to the Survivor face down. 
        - Then, the player places the Survivor Card face-up on top of the pile, and sets this pile aside. 
            - Should any player die, this Survivor and deck will replace them. 

3E. RESOLVING SALVAGE CARDS
    - Take any remaining salvage cards and add them to your hand. 
    - Salvage Cards may be FOOD cards, WEAPON cards, ALLY cards, or CHARM cards. 
    - FOOD 
        - These cards prevent you from starving. 
    - WEAPON
        - These cards help you fight off Catastrophes.
    - MEDICAL 
        - These cards help prevent injuries and shed Catastrophes from your deck. 
    - ALLY 
        - These cards provide miscellaneous positive effects. 
    - CHARM
        - A one-time positive effect happens. Resolve the effects of the card, then discard it. 

3F. RECOVERING LOCATIONS
    - If a Location card is ever cleared of Catastrophe Tokens, it has been Recovered! 
    - If a Location card that is cleared of Catastrophe Tokens gains another Catastrophe Card (and Token), it is no longer Recovered. 
    - A Location is worth a certain amount of Victory Points.
    - If 10 Victory Points worth of Locations are Recovered at the same time, the game is won. 

4. HUNGER
* In this phase, each player must Trash a "Food" Salvage Card or take a card from the Catastrophe deck and place it in their discard pile. 
    - If a player's discard pile ever contains 3 Catastrophe cards, that player's turn ends immediately and her current Survivor dies. This is bad. 

5. REST
* In this phase, one player takes the top card from the Night Deck and resolves it. 
* After that, all players discard all cards remaining in their hands. 
    - If a player's discard pile ever contains 3 Catastrophe cards, that player's turn ends immediately and her current Survivor dies. This is bad. 
* The player now shuffles his discard pile with his existing deck to create a new deck. 
* If a Mournful Sacrifice player still has his one Salvage card by the end of the turn, it is Trashed. 

DEATH
*****
* Should a player die, he immediately places his hand and deck into his discard pile.
* This discard pile is placed face-down on the Graveyard location. 
* The Graveyard location can be explored like any other location. 
    - However, a Recovered Graveyard is worth 0 Victory Points, and 
    - Survivors found in the Graveyard are not added to the Survivor pool. They are dead.
        - Instead, draw and resolve the top card from the Catastrophe deck. 
* In the next WAKE UP phase, if there are Survivors who are not in play, the player chooses from one of the Survivor placed aside earlier. 
    - The player takes this deck, adds 2 cards from the Salvage Deck, the Survivor Card, and shuffles them all together to make a new deck.
    - The player then starts the WAKE UP phase as normal. 
    - This occurs in the order that the players have died. 
        - Example: 
            - In Round 3, Alice's Survivor dies while exploring the Empty Skyscraper. 
            - Then, Bob's Survivor dies of starvation in the Hunger phase. 
            - Finally, Carl's Survivor bleeds out in his sleep in the Rest phase. 
            - At the beginning of Round 4, Alice gets first pick of the Survivors. 
            - Bob gets second pick.
            - That's all the Survivors that are left. Carl gets nothing. 
            - In Round 4, Bob finds a Survivor in the Empty Skyscraper. 
            - At the beginning of Round 5, Carl gets the newly found Subscriber.
