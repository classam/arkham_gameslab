GAME START
**********

* Players start with a deck containing - 

4 bullets ( SALVAGE ) 
4 tinned ham ( SALVAGE )
1 SURVIVOR card
1 mild injury ( CATASTROPHE )

* The "Graveyard" and "Apartment Building" Locations are put into play.

PHASES
******

* A game day consists of 5 phases: 

1. WAKE UP
2. PLAN
3. EXPLORE
4. HUNGER
5. REST

1. WAKE UP
* Players draw 5 cards from their deck, and place them face-up in front of them. 

2. PLAN
* Players may exchange Salvage Cards with one another. 
* Trades must be 1-for-1. 
* Only one trade may take place between any set of 2 players in a turn. 
    - example: In a game containing Alice, Bob, and Carl...
        - Alice can trade with Bob, once
        - Alice can trade with Carl, once
        - Carl can trade with Bob, once
* Survivor Cards and Injury Cards may not be traded. 

3. EXPLORE
* In the explore phase, all players either: 
    - Explore a NEW LOCATION
    or
    - Explore an already explored LOCATION

3A. NEW LOCATION
    - Draw a Location from the Location Deck.
    - Draw as many cards from each Deck as are listed on the Location card, shuffle them together, and create a deck with them.
        - Place this deck face-down next to the upturned Location card. We shall refer to this as the "Event Deck"
    - Example: 
        LOCATION: Mall
            Catastrophe: 7
            Salvage: 4
            Survivors: 1
            VP: 1
        - In this case, we would draw 
            - 7 cards from the Catastrophe Deck, 
            - 4 cards from the Salvage Deck, and 
            - 1 card from the Survivors Deck, 
            - shuffle them together to make the Mall's Event Deck, and place them face down next to the Mall card. 
    - Then, draw and resolve the top card from the newly created Event Deck. 

3B. EXPLORED LOCATION
    - Draw 1-4 cards, face-down from the top of the explored location's Event Deck.
    - Flip all of the cards at the same time. 
    - First, the player resolves all of the Catastrophe Cards. 
    - Then the player resolves all of the Survivor Cards.
    - Then, the player takes any remaining Salvage Cards and adds them to his hand. 

3C. RESOLVING CATASTROPHE CARDS
    - A catastrophe card might be a FIGHT, an INJURY, or a JINX 
    - FIGHT
        - Someone or something wants to make you dead. Play WEAPON cards to make this not happen. 
    - INJURY
        - You have managed to injure yourself. Play MEDICAL cards to make this not happen. 
    - JINX
        - Something bad happens. Resolve the effects of the card. 

    - Any catastrophe that you fail to resolve goes into your discard pile. 
    - If your discard pile ever contains 3 Catastrophe cards, your turn ends and your Survivor dies. This is bad. 

3D. RESOLVING SURVIVOR CARDS
    - You have found a Survivor in the wreckage! 
    - You may give the Survivor any Salvage cards from your hand or any Salvage cards from the current Exploration. 
        - Place any cards that you have given the Survivor face down. Place the Survivor Card face-up on top of the pile, and set this pile aside. 
            - Should any member of your party die, this Survivor and his deck will replace them.
