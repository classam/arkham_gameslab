EPOCH ELLIPSE 
*************
The end has come and gone.  After a century of infinite growth, everything has come full circle.

There is no food. There is no power. The few people who are left squabble over scraps.  

And a small group of survivors band together to take back what is left of their city.

WIN/LOSE
********

This is a limited co-operative game.  Each player wins by surviving to the end.  This is best accomplished by working with others. 

The game ends if all players have Recovered 10VP worth of Locations. 
All players lose if no Survivors remain alive. 

GAME START
**********

* Players start with a deck containing - 

4 bullets ( SALVAGE - WEAPON ) 
4 tinned ham ( SALVAGE - FOOD)
1 SURVIVOR card
1 mild injury ( CRISIS - COLLAPSE )

* The "Wasteland", "Dispensary", and "Apartment Building" Locations are put into play. 


TRASH VS. DISCARD
*****************
* Trashed cards are placed on the top of the Wasteland's Event Deck. 
* Discarded cards are placed in the player's discard pile. They remain a part of the player's deck. 


PHASES
******

* A game day consists of 5 phases: 

1. WAKE UP
2. PLAN
3. EXPLORE
4. HUNGER
5. REST

1. WAKE UP
* Each Player draws 5 cards from her Survivor's deck.
    - If the deck has less than five cards, tough beans. 
* Cards are not private, and any player may see any other player's cards. 

3. EXPLORE
* In the explore phase, each player must either: 
    - Explore a NEW LOCATION, alone
    or
    - Explore an already EXPLORED LOCATION, alone.
* If one player explores a NEW LOCATION, any player who has not yet explored a location that turn may treat that location as an EXPLORED LOCATION.
* If two players wish to explore the same Location in a turn, they must decide in which order they plan to explore the Location, and proceed one at a time.  

3A. NEW LOCATION
    - Draw a Location from the Location Deck.
    - Draw as many cards from each Deck as are listed on the Location card, shuffle them together, and create a deck with them.
        - Place this deck face-down next to the upturned Location card. We shall refer to this as the "Event Deck"
    - Example: 
        LOCATION: Mall
            Crisis: 7
            Salvage: 4
            Survivors: 1
            VP: 1
        - In this case, we would draw 
            - 7 cards from the Crisis Deck, 
            - 4 cards from the Salvage Deck, and 
            - 1 card from the Survivors Deck, 
            - shuffle them together to make the Mall's Event Deck, and place them face down next to the Mall card. 
    - For each card from the Crisis Deck that has been placed in the Event Deck, place a Crisis Token on the Location Card. 
    - Then, the player draws and resolves the top card from the newly created Event Deck. 

3B. EXPLORED LOCATION
    - Shuffle the explored location's Event Deck. 
    - Draw 2 or 4 cards, face-down, from the top of the explored location's Event Deck.
        - This set of cards is the current Exploration. 
    - Flip all of the cards in the Exploration at the same time. 
    - First, the player resolves all of the Crisis Cards. 
    - Then the player resolves all of the Survivor Cards.
    - Then the player resolves all of the Salvage Cards.

3C. RESOLVING CRISIS CARDS
    - A Crisis Card might be a COMBAT, a COLLAPSE, or a CATASTROPHE
    - COMBAT
        - Someone or something wants to make the player dead. Play WEAPON cards to make this not happen. 
    - COLLAPSE
        - The player has managed to injure herself. Play MEDICAL cards to make this not happen. 
    - CATASTROPHE
        - This is a challenge that affects every player.  

    - If a player dies during an Exploration, all remaining Crisis, Survivor, and Salvage cards from the Exploration are returned to the Location's Event Deck.


3D. RESOLVING SURVIVOR CARDS
    - The player has found a Survivor in the wreckage! 
    - The player may give the Survivor any Salvage cards from her hand or any Salvage cards from the current Exploration. 
        - The player places any cards that he will give to the Survivor face down. 
        - Then, the player places the Survivor Card face-up on top of the pile, and sets this pile aside. 
            - Should any player die, this Survivor and deck will replace them. 

3E. RESOLVING SALVAGE CARDS
    - Take any remaining salvage cards and add them to your hand. 
    - Salvage Cards may be FOOD cards, WEAPON cards, MEDICAL cards, ALLY cards, or CHARM cards. 
    - FOOD 
        - These cards prevent you from starving. 
    - WEAPON
        - These cards help you fight off Crises.
    - MEDICAL 
        - These cards help prevent injuries and shed Crises from your deck. 
    - ALLY 
        - These cards provide miscellaneous positive effects. 
    - EVENT
        - A one-time positive effect happens. Resolve the effects of the card, then discard it. 
    - A player may not have more than 5 cards in hand.  Any cards over the limit are returned to the Location's Event Deck, face down. 

3F. RECOVERING LOCATIONS
    - If a Location's Event Deck is empty, it has been Recovered!
    - If a Location's Event Deck is rendered no-longer empty, it is no longer Recovered. 
    - A Location is worth a certain amount of Victory Points.
    - If 10 Victory Points worth of Locations are Recovered at the same time, the game is won. 

4. HUNGER
* In this phase, each player must produce at least one point of "Food" from a Salvage Card or take a card from the Crisis deck and place it immediately in their discard pile. 

5. REST
* In this phase, one player takes the top card from the Night Deck and resolves it. 
* After that, all players discard all cards remaining in their hands. 
* The player now shuffles his discard pile with his existing deck to create a new deck. 
* If a Sacrifice player still has his one Salvage or Crisis card by the end of the turn, it is Trashed. 


DEATH
*****
* If a player's discard pile ever contains 3 Crisis cards, that player's turn ends immediately and her current Survivor dies. This is bad. 
* Should a player die, he immediately places his hand and deck into his discard pile.
* This discard pile is placed face-down on the Wasteland location. 
* The Wasteland location can be explored like any other location. 
    - However, a Recovered Wasteland is worth 0 Victory Points, and 
    - Survivors found in the Wasteland are not added to the Survivor pool. They are dead.
        - Instead, draw and resolve the top card from the Crisis deck. 
* In the next WAKE UP phase, if the player has any Survivor decks put aside, she may start anew with her rescued Survivor. 
    - The player takes this deck, adds 2 cards from the Common Salvage Deck, the Survivor Card, and shuffles them all together to make a new deck.
    - The player then starts the WAKE UP phase as normal. 

TRADE
*****
* Between phases, players may trade Salvage cards freely between one another. 
* Survivor cards and Crisis cards may not be played. 

MEDICAL CARE
************
* Medical cards may be played at any time. 
* For every point of "Medical" generated, a player may Trash one Crisis card from their hand or Discard pile.  

COMBAT
******
* Crisis - Combat cards are events where your character has to fight to proceed. 
* A Combat card will have a Difficulty rating.
* In order to win the combat, the player must produce at least this many points from Salvage - Weapon cards. 
* If the Combat is won, the Crisis is placed in the Wasteland. 
* If the Combat is lost, the Crisis is placed in the player's discard pile.
