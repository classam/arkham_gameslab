Title: "Survivor" 
Dr Max Health MD:
    Title: "Dr. Max Health, M.D." 
    Profession: "Soap Opera Actor" 
    Once Per Day: "<em>Emergency</em>: When a player would gain an Injury die, roll a die. On a 6, the player does not take the Injury, but instead gives Dr. Max Health M.D. a Salvage from his hand."
    Once Per Game: "<em>Combat Hospital</em>: All players may discard a die."   
    Weakness: "<em>Not Actually a Doctor</em>: When \"Emergency\" actually works, make a Trauma roll." 
    Flavor: "His real name was Anthony Kaladosis, and he played \"Dr. Max Health, M.D.\" on the popular soap opera, \"Danger Hospital\". 
        After the Great Catastrophe, he certainly coudln't survive. Not as Anthony Kaladosis, the now-starving ex-actor.<br/>
        But it seemed like everybody needed a doctor. Anthony had some basic first aid training, and a few medical tidbits from the show. 
        And most importantly, he could definitely play the part of a melodramatic television doctor. People needed that, right? 
        They'd certainly help him out with a bit of food here and there. <br/> 
        Anthony played the role of Dr. Max Health, M.D., 24 hours a day, moving from group to group, pretending to be a doctor.<br/>
        It wasn't long before Anthony began to disappear into his character..." 
Jai Jayendra: 
    Profession: "Martial Arts Enthusiast / Cashier" 
    Once Per Day: "<em>Human Weapon</em>: 1 Weapon. " 
    Once Per Game: "<em>Human Typhoon</em>: 5 Weapon. " 
    Weakness: "<em>Human Catastrophe</em>: Whenever Jai would roll Injury die, instead roll twice. "
    Flavor: "Jai was a cashier. <br/>
        She hated her job.  Day in, day out, beep. Beep. Beep. That'll be twelve ninety two.  <br/>
        She didn't think of herself as a cashier. She thought of herself as a warrior. <br/>
        She trained in a variety of martial arts. She learned how to fire a variety of weapons, accurately.
        She tried to join the military, but refused when they wouldn't let her take a front-line position. <br/>
        Part of the problem was that she was five-foot-two, and a bit clumsy. <br/>
        When the Great Catastrophe came, she took to the streets. Finally, an opportunity to prove herself.
        Some people would need to be broken, and Jai would be there to break them. " 
Justice Lin: 
    Profession: "Paralegal" 
    Once Per Day: "<em>Exploratory</em>: Redraw one Crisis card drawn during Exploration." 
    Once Per Game: "<em>Filibuster</em>: All players get another Emplacement phase this turn. "
    Weakness: "<em>Compulsive</em>: If Justice doesn't have an even number of dice at the end of the Day, she makes a Trauma roll. " 
    Flavor: "Justice enjoyed her work as a paralegal.  This was unusual. Nobody enjoyed being a paralegal.  The job was stultifying.  
    It was the same routine, constantly, without end. Filing. Research. Filing. Research. Justice enjoyed it because of the structure, becuase 
    with careful planning of her day and therapeutic drugs, she could almost make it an entire day without counting all of the doorknobs in her building. <br/> 
    There were 183.<br/> 
    After the Great Catastrophe, Justice was lost.  Her compulsions spiraled out of control.  There was no structure, she couldn't find the drugs that she needed. <br/>
    But a group of survivors found her, fed her.  Despite her problems, she was very intelligent, extremely organized, a clever arbitator.
    When they found her, she was starving, and alone, and she was carrying a sack. Inside the sack was exactly 183 doorknobs."  
Naoki Urasawa:
    Profession: "Student"
    Once Per Day: "<em>Creative Eater</em>: Naoki does not require food." 
    Once Per Game: "<em>Deadline Dodge</em>: Naoki does not participate in or suffer the effects of the end-of-day Catastrophe." 
    Weakness: "<em>Disorganized</em>: Naoki's hand limit is 5, rather than 7."
    Flavor: "Naoki was a career student, with a knack for doing exactly enough work to get a C-. 
        So long as he remained on the cusp of completion of a degree, he wouldn't have to come home and take a position in the family's 
        fish-canning factory. So Naoki maintained a position exactly three credits away from a degree in Engineering, Chemistry, Art History, 
        Dance, and Geriatric Science. When the Great Catastrophe occurred, Naoki was subsiding on a thin diet of ramen noodles and miscellany, and
        deciding whether his next swap would be into Nuclear Physics or Canadian Cultural Studies.<br/>
        His creative eating skills, intelligent laziness, and low caloric requirements made him surprisingly apocalypse-resistant. 
        All he had to do was hide from the scary things long enough for them to go away and he would be fine. So he hid."
Rodrigo Gabriel: 
    Profession: "Salvager/Survivalist"
    Once Per Day: "<em>Found</em>: Draw 1 Common Salvage and add it to your hand."
    Once Per Game: "<em>Restock</em>: Make a Salvage roll and add it to your hand." 
    Weakness: "<em>Honest</em>: Rodrigo refuses to steal cards or give away dice. If Rodrigo would give away a new die, instead take that die."
    Flavor: "Rodrigo didn't particularly like the city.  He enjoyed being far, far away from civilization.  
    All he needed was a knife and a soft place to sleep, and he was as happy as a pig in a poke. <br/> 
    But he couldn't stay away forever, so he worked in a series of warehouses, quitting one when he had had enough of humanity. <br/> 
    After the Great Catastrophe, he started to treat the ruined city as a new place to demonstrate his survival skills. 
    And he knew where to find the best stuff in dozens of crushed storerooms around the city.
    "
Jeff Wheeler: 
    Profession: "Welder"
    Once Per Day: "<em>Fixed It</em>: When Jeff would Trash a card from his hand, instead put it in the Stockpile." 
    Once Per Game: "<em>Stockpile Crash</em>: Jeff may draw 2 cards from the Stockpile for each player and distribute them, then take 2 for himself."
    Weakness: "<em>Accident-Prone</em>: Jeff may not use the Stockpile emplacement. "
    Flavor: "Jeff Wheeler could build anything out of anything. 
    His personal crowning moment was when he successfully converted a tin can full of black powder and a digital watch into a miniature explosive device. <br/>
    His co-workers poked fun at him for his blackened hands and burnt-off eyebrows, but Jeff's hobby was more important to him than mere eyebrows. <br/>
    After the Great Catastrophe, Jeff just had more time to jury-rig things into other things. So much so that, when he finally found a group of survivors willing
    to overlook his propensity for accidentally lighting his compatriots on fire, they permanently banned him from getting anywhere near their stockpile of ammunition."
The King: 
    Profession: "Mutant"
    Once Per Day: "<em>Mutate</em>: Trash 1 Mutation. Draw 1 Mutation<br/><em> -or- </em><br/>Trash 1 Die. Draw a Radation Die." 
    Once Per Game: "<em>Third Eye</em>: The King may add his Radiation Die to his Salvage die, and make 1 Salvage roll." 
    Weakness: "<em>Cancer</em>: The King makes an extra Radiation roll at the end of the game."
    Flavor: "Nobody knows where The King came from.  He must have been a human at some point.  He certainly didn't look much like one anymore. 
    The only thing that kept him looking even remotely humanoid was his navy-blue blazer. He wore it all the time.
    Clearly an expensive brand-name, with a miniature American Flag pin on the lapel, looking as old and battered as The King himself. <br/>
    The King refused to talk about it. All he would say is that he was ashamed of what he had done, and he deserved to be the way that he was. <br/>
    And every time The King talked about the Great Catastrophe, he got a very sad look in his eyes. "
X2021:
    Title: "X-2021" 
    Profession: "Murderous Android Posing as a Human" 
    Once Per Day: "<em>Mock Emotion</em>: Ignore a pair on a Trauma roll." 
    Once Per Game: "<em>Kill All Hu-Mons</em>: Give each other player 1 Die from your pile. "
    Weakness: "<em>Fooling Nobody</em>: X2021 may not trade cards, and must feed himself." 
    Flavor: "Model: X - Human Extermination / Garbage Disposal. <br/>
             Year: 2021 <br/>
             Operating System: Debuntu Hat X - Window Lion <br/> 
             Turing Score: 84<br/>
             \"I don't know why they want to kill all humans - but they don't ever seem to follow through. 
             I'd want to kill all humans, too, if I were programmed to collect their garbage.\" - David Chandra, lead programmer for the X-2021 series."

    Title: "'Krazy' Karl Danvers"
    Profession: "BMX Stunt Racer / Bicycle Messenger"
    Once Per Day: "<em>Full Throttle</em>: Visit one additional Location after all players have completed their Settlement phase. Make an Injury roll."
    Once Per Game: "<em>'Watch This!'</em>: All players may skip their next Trauma roll."
    Weakness: "<em>One Stunt Too Many</em>: Karl starts with 1 Injury die."
    Flavor: "'Krazy' Karl Danvers earned his nickname by jumping a car on his BMX when he was 10 years old. He never looked back from that day.<br/>
    When he was 25 and still zooming around dirt tracks, his mother decided it was time he got a real job, but Karl wouldn't budge. 
    While good enough for the local circuit, he could never quite break into the big time.
    It wasn't until he was almost killed by a bicycle messenger in New York that he managed to turn his hobby into a career: cycling.<br/>
    Unfortunately for Karl, he still travels more by ricochet than pedal power, but he does get from A to B faster than most."
Buddy:
    Profession: "Six-String Samurai"
    Once Per Day: "<em>Wasteland Wanderer</em>: Roll 1 less Radiation die on a Radiation roll."
    Once Per Game: "<em>'If You Scratch My Guitar, I'll Kill You'</em>: Pass any Combat Crisis."
    Weakness: "<em>'Damn Kid'</em>: Buddy will not Trash an Ally, but can Trade an Ally if he receives an Ally in return."
    Flavor: "Buddy has a gig in Vegas. He's going to be the next King of Rock and Roll. <br/>
    And no one had better mess with him until he does. He just didn't count on The Kid tagging along for the ride.<br/>
    Buddy' not entirely sure how it happened, but The Kid has grown on him. Well, not like a tumor or anything..."
Angela Garmin:
    Profession: "Thief"
    Once Per Day: "<em>Sticky Fingers</em>: Take 1 Common Salvage, at random, from the player with the most Salvage."
    Once Per Game: "<em>Robbing Them Blind</em>: Take any 3 cards from the Stockpile."
    Weakness: "<em>Guilty Conscience</em>: Whenever Angela is given cards by another player - either during the Stockpile phase or from a Stockpile effect - she must give at least one card back. If Angela has no cards in hand, she cannot be given cards."
    Flavor: "Angela Garmin is no stranger to getting herself out of sticky situations...it's just that she's usually the one to cause them.<br/>
    The Great Catastrophe though...that was new. She tried going back to the life after the shock wore off, but then she seemed like every other scrounger and scaveneger out there.<br/>
    Trying to fit in with other survivors didn't work either: she was either caught with her hand in a cookie jar or, sometimes, treated with such kindness that she couldn't help but empty her pockets.<br/>
    Angela's not sure if she wants to hook up with other survivors again, but given the choice between dealing with people or starving on her own, it's an easy choice."
Sargeant Douglas Rogers:
    Title: "Sgt. Douglas Rogers"
    Profession: "Paramilitary"
    Once Per Day: "<em>Combat Training</em>: +2 Weapon if not using any weapons."
    Once Per Game: "<em>Berserker</em>: +5 Weapon. Take an Injury die."
    Weakness: "<em>Unbalanced</em>: Douglas starts with 1 Trauma die."
    Flavor: "Drummed out of the special forces for insubordination. Quickly let go from a merc group for making too much mess. Sacked from a bodyguard job for excessive force and assault charges.<br/>
    The sheet on Douglas Rogers is filled with black marks. But none blacker than having no options left but to join a paramilitary force patrolling the Arizona-Mexico border for illegals.<br/>
    When the bombs fell, Douglas realized he had a fresh start. And every time he cut down some raider or mutant, he felt like he was hacking away a piece of his past."
Honest Herb Truman:
    Title: "'Honest' Hal Truman"
    Profession: "Used Car Salesman"
    Once Per Day: "<em>Fast Talker</em>: During a Combat Crisis against Marauders or Raiders, Trash 1 Salvage and roll a die. On a 4-6, ignore the Crisis."
    Once Per Game: "<em>Caravan</em>: Using the Stockpile, Herb may exchange Common Salvage for Rare Salvage at 3:1 and visa-versa. Gained cards are placed in the Stockpile and may not be exchanged again."
    Weakness: "<em>Big Eater</em>: Herb may not give away food and does not generate surplus food."
    Flavor: "Hal Truman loved his cars. The only thing he loved more was Snacky Cakes and, thanks to his successful used auto dealership, he had been surrounded by both.<br/>
    His cars are all gone. They're all burnt-out husks of their former selves. And if he doesn't find any more of his beloved Cakes, so will Hal.<br/>
    But years of selling cars have honed his salesmanship, and there's no one hungier to make a deal."
Sneaky Pete Anderson:
    Profession: "Grifter"
    Once Per Day: "<em>Three-card Monty</em>: Roll an additional die when making a Salvage roll."
    Once Per Game: "<em>Landing the Whale</em>: Trash 1 Common Salvage. Gain 2 Rare Salvage."
    Weakness: "<em>Shell Game</em>: Pete does not gain Common Salvage when making personal Salvage rolls. Salvage rolls that add to the Stockpile are unaffected."
    Flavor: "Pete Anderson was always on the move. It was the only way to keep the marks fresh and the cops guessing.<br/>
    He's not even sure 'Anderson' is his real last name anymore. And with all the police reports so much ash, it's a good a name as any.<br/>
    All he needs to do is stay alive until tomorrow and hope the right sucker drops into his lap."
Coach Herschel Martin:
    Profession: "Football Coach"
    Once Per Day: "<em>'You Hit Like a Girl'</em>: Add +1 Weapon to any other player's combat. That player makes a Trauma roll."
    Once Per Game: "<em>Hail Mary</em>: Add +3 Weapon to any 3 separate Combat Crises this phase."
    Weakness: "<em>Armchair Quarterback</em>: Cannot use Grenades or other thrown weapons."
    Flavor: "Herschel Martin has dreams. Nightmares. The sound of bone crunching still wakes him at night long after the bones have healed.<br/>
    His shoulder still doesn't work right, but he knows he's got a few good tosses left in him. He's got a couple grenades in a satchel just in case the scouts are watching.<br/>
    Until then, he tries to keep everyone else focused on the job at hand and no time to pity a never-was."
Vladimir Konroyd:
    Profession: "Handyman / Substitute High School Shop Teacher"
    Once Per Day: "<em>Duct Tape</em>: May add 1 to a die roll to determine the condition of a single weapon."
    Once Per Game: "<em>Roll of Duct Tape</em>: "Use any weapon to add 5 weapon to another weapon. Trash both weapons at the end of the combat."
    Weakness: "<em>Sight of His Own Blood</em>: Whenever Vladimir makes an Injury roll, he also makes a Trauma roll."
    Flavor: "'Vlad the Impaler' they called him. He always claimed it was the pain that made him pass out, but the kids knew it was the blood.<br/>
    He'd became a handyman as a way to face his fears, but he gotten good enough that he almost never hurt himself.<br/>
    But that was with power tools. All sorts of things were out for his blood now."
Patrica Walker:
    Profession: "Therapist"
    Once Per Day: "<em>'I Charge on a Sliding Scale'</em>: Another player pays you X common salvage to ignore X Trauma dice on a Trauma roll."
    Once Per Game: "<em>'Group Hug, Everyone!'<em/>: All players discard one Trauma die."
    Weakness: "<em>Personal Demons</em>: Whenever Patricia fails a Trauma roll, she must roll again."
    Flavor: "Patricia Walker was never one who ever cared to color in the lines. Sex, booze, drugs...you name it, she did it. A lot of it<br/>
    Until one day, she'd just had enough. With friends and family behind her, she got cleaned up and learned to help others do the same.<br/>
    The Great Catastrophe found her at the far end of her own road to redemption. Unfortunately for Patricia, she hasn't travelled nearly as far as she thinks.<br/>
    And old habits are hard to break."
Shaun McMurtry:
    Profession: "Short-order Cook / Ex-Mob Hitman"
    Once Per Day: "<em>Feeding the Family</em>: Play X food to produce X+1 food."
    Once Per Game: "<em>Just Like the Old Days</em>: Pass a Combat Crisis of Difficulty 9 or less."
    Weakness: "<em>The Past Catches Up</em>: Whenever fighting Marauders or Raiders, roll a die. On a 1 or 2, increase the Difficulty by 3."
    Flavor: "Sean McMurtry never played well with others. Maybe that's why he was so good at killing them. Not that anyone needed to know that.<br/>
    Most of the boys only knew him as the guy who slung the hash at the diner. It was easier that way. No connections, no problems.<br/>
    But he got bored and wanted out, so he made a hole through a good chunk of the south side. <br/>
    Some of the old gang are still around, running with raiders and the like. So are the rumors. They still talk about the guy who broke more than just eggs."
