Wasteland
=========

INTRO
-----

The end has come and gone.  After a century of infinite growth, everything has come full circle.

There is no food. There is no power. The few people who are left squabble over scraps.  

A small group of survivors have banded together and formed a settlement.

Things were going as well as could be expected until the survivors encountered a panicked man from another settlement. 

The man's small settlement had been destroyed by a band of marauders, hundreds strong. And they were headed this way. 

The survivors weren't going anywhere.  They had made a home here. They were going to stand and fight.  

They needed to build a fortress. They had 1 week.

GAME START
----------

- The last person to have killed a person with his bare hands gets the First Player's Trophy.
    - In the (admittedly likely) case of a tie, choose the first player with a die roll. 

- All players receive a choice of two Survivor Cards. 
    - The chosen Survivor Card is placed in front of the player. 

- All players recieve 2 Common Salvage Cards. 
    - The Common Salvage Cards compose the player's hand. 

- Put the Starting Emplacements in play, in the center of the table. 
    - They say "Starting" on them.
    - Shuffle the rest of them, and place their deck face-down somewhere.

- Shuffle all remaining decks and place them face down, near the play area. 

- Create a deck-sized hole next to the Stockpile Emplacement. This is the "Stockpile". Put 3 Common Salvage in the Stockpile.  

- Put a Super Catastrophe into play, Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3, all face-down. 

- Next to the Super Catastrophe, play 6 face-down Catastrophe cards, next to one another.  These compose the players' week. 

- Flip the first Catastrophe of the week face-up. 

DAY
---

- A game day consists of phases: 

1. EMPLACEMENT
2. EXPLORATION
3. CATASTROPHE
4. HUNGER
5. STOCKPILE

### EMPLACEMENT ###
- The Round begins.
- Reveal today's Catastrophe card. Read it aloud.
- Each player, starting from the First player, chooses and resolves an Emplacement. 
- An Emplacement cannot be resolved twice in the same turn. 

#### WASTELAND ####
- The "Wasteland" is not really an Emplacement and should not be treated as such.
- Mutiple players can use the Wasteland in a turn.
- The "Wasteland" cannot be destroyed.
- If the Wasteland is the only remaining emplacement, all players lose. 

### EXPLORATION ###

#### EXPLORATION SALVAGE ROLL ####
- Each player makes a Salvage roll, and adds the result to the Stockpile. 
    - Regardless of how many "Common Salvage" die the character might roll, each character can put a maximum of one Common Salvage in the Stockpile.
    - On a pair, add a Crisis to today's Exploration alongside the Rare Salvage.
    - On a three-of-a-kind, add a Catastrophe to today's exploration alongside the extra Salvage Die.

#### NEW EMPLACEMENT ####
- If a player has chosen the Outpost Emplacement, he draws 3 cards from the top of the Emplacement Deck, chooses one, and adds it to the settlement.
    - Discard the other settlement.
- If there is no player on the Outpost, draw the top Emplacement and add it to the the settlement. 

#### CRISES ####
- If a player has chosen the Scout Emplacement, he:
    - draws one Crisis card for each player
    - draws one extra Crisis card
    - discards one Crisis card
    - then deals them out, one per player, in the order that he chooses. 
    - in the case that there are more Crisis cards than players, each player must recieve a second Crisis before receiving a third, and so forth. 
        - so, you can't just dump all of the Crises on one unlucky player. 
- If there is no Scout, draw a Crisis card from the top of the deck for each player, starting with the first player. 

##### COMBAT #####
- Crisis - Combat cards are events where your character has to fight to proceed. 
- A Combat card will have a Difficulty rating.
- First the player will choose any weapons that he will use in the combat. The player is now committed to use all of these weapons, regardless of outcome.
- The player now rolls a die and adds any weapon modifiers to that die.
- If the number is greater than or equal to the Combat's difficulty, the player wins! 
- Roll to keep weapons used in combat. 
- Weapons played in combat are 'used' for the rest of the turn. They return to the player's hand in the Stockpile phase. 

### CATASTROPHE ###
- Resolve the current day's catastrophe.

### HUNGER ###
- Each player, starting from the first player, gets one opportunity to play food cards. 
- At the end of the round, each player must have produced 1 Food for his survivor. 
- If a player produces more food than his survivors can eat, he can choose which player gets the surplus.
- Any food generated by a card that is not consumed by the end of the turn is discarded. 
- Any player without 1 food at the end of the turn takes 1 Injury Die. 

### STOCKPILE ###
- Return any played cards to your hand. 
- Players may trade cards. ( _only_ during the Stockpile phase.) 
- Each player has a hand-limit of 7 cards, including Mutations. If this hand limit is exceeded, the extra Salvage goes to the Stockpile.
- The First Player Trophy passes to the left of the First Player. 

ROLLS
-----
- When you get a die of any color, make a roll.

- On a single Salvage Die, gain a Common Salvage
- On a pair of Radiation Dice, gain a Mutation
- On a pair of Trauma Dice, discard a Salvage at random.
- On a pair of Injury Dice, gain a Trauma die  
- On a pair of Salvage Dice, gain a Rare Salvage
- On a three-of-a-kind of any color, gain another die of that color without triggering a re-roll. 
- On a four-of-a-kind of Radiation, Trauma, or Injury, you die. 
- On a four-of-a-kind or better of Salvage Dice, you gain 1 Rare Salvage and re-roll. 

- If you get two pairs on a roll, you get the penalty (or reward) twice. 

DEATH
-----
- Should a Survivor die, that Survivor's Salvage cards are placed in the Stockpile. 
- The Survivor's dice are discarded. 
- The dead survivor chooses an emplacement to damage. 

TRASH, STOCKPILE, or PLAY
-------------------------
Cards that are Trashed are placed in a pile next to their respective decks, to be shuffled back in as necessary. 
Cards that are Stockpiled are placed in the Stockpile. 
Cards that are Played are placed in front of the player, and cannot be used again this turn.  

SHARED COMBAT
-------------

- All players choose the weapons and mutations that they will use, and place them in front of themselves, face down.
- All players flip their weapons simultaneously.
- Every player rolls. The total of all player rolls and all weapons must meet or exceed the Shared Combat's difficulty to pass.
