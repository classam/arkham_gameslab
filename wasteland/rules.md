INTRO
-----

The end has come and gone.  After a century of infinite growth, everything has come full circle.

There is no food. There is no power. The few people who are left squabble over scraps.  

A small group of survivors have banded together and formed a settlement.

Things were going as well as could be expected until the survivors encountered a panicked man from another settlement. 

The man's small settlement had been destroyed by a band of marauders, hundreds strong. And they were headed this way. 

The survivors weren't going anywhere.  They had made a home here. They were going to stand and fight.  

They needed to build a fortress. They had 1 week.

DAY
---

- A game day consists of phases: 

1. EMPLACEMENT
2. EXPLORATION
3. CATASTROPHE
4. HUNGER
5. STOCKPILE

### EMPLACEMENT ###
- The Round begins.
- Reveal today's Catastrophe card. Read it aloud.
- Each player, starting from the First player, chooses and resolves an Emplacement. 
- An Emplacement cannot be resolved twice in the same turn. 

### EXPLORATION ###
- If a player has chosen to be the Exploration Leader, he draws 2 cards from the top of the Emplacement Deck, chooses one, and adds it to the settlement.
    - Discard the other settlement.
- If there is no Exploration Leader, draw the top Emplacement and add it to the the settlement. 

- If a player has chosen to be the Exploration Leader, he draws one Crisis card for each player, then deals them out, one per player, in the order that he chooses. 
- If there is no Exploration Leader, draw a Crisis card from the top of the deck for each player, starting with the first player. 

#### COMBAT ####
- Crisis - Combat cards are events where your character has to fight to proceed. 
- A Combat card will have a Difficulty rating.
- First the player will choose any weapons that he will use in the combat. The player is now committed to use all of these weapons, regardless of outcome.
- The player now rolls a die and adds any weapon modifiers to that die.
- If the number is greater than or equal to the Combat's difficulty, the player wins! 
- Roll to keep weapons used in combat. 
- Weapons played in combat are 'used' for the rest of the turn. They return to the player's hand in the Stockpile phase. 

### CATASTROPHE ###
- Resolve the current day's catastrophe.

### HUNGER ###
- Each player, starting from the first player, gets one opportunity to play food cards. 
- At the end of the round, each player must have produced 1 Food for his survivor. 
- If a player produces more food than his survivors can eat, he can choose which player gets the surplus.
- Any food generated by a card that is not consumed by the end of the turn is discarded. 

### STOCKPILE ###
- Players may trade cards _only_ during the Stockpile phase. 
- Each player makes a Salvage roll, and adds the result to the Stockpile. 
    - Regardless of how many "Common Salvage" die the character might roll, each character can put a maximum of one Common Salvage in the Stockpile.
    - If the player has any rolled Salvage die, as trophies, that would benefit the current roll, they may add them to the roll. 
- Each player has a hand-limit of 7 cards, including Mutations. If this hand limit is exceeded, the extra Salvage goes to the Stockpile.
- The First Player Trophy passes to the left of the First Player. 

ROLLS
-----
- When you get a die of any color, make a roll.

- On a single Salvage Die, gain a Common Salvage
- On a pair of Radiation Dice, gain a Mutation
- On a pair of Trauma Dice, discard a Salvage at random.
- On a pair of Injury Dice, gain a Trauma die  
- On a pair of Salvage Dice, gain a Rare Salvage

DEATH
-----
- Should a Survivor die, that Survivor's Salvage cards are placed in the Stockpile. 
- The Survivor's dice are discarded. 
- The dead survivor chooses an emplacement to damage. 

TRASH, STOCKPILE, or PLAY
-------------------------
Cards that are Trashed are placed in a pile next to their respective decks, to be shuffled back in as necessary. 
Cards that are Stockpiled are placed in the Stockpile. 
Cards that are Played are placed in front of the player, and cannot be used again this turn. 

SHARED COMBAT
-------------
- Same as a normal combat, but every player contributes die and weapon towards the roll. 
- All players choose the weapons and mutations that they will use, and place them in front of themselves, face down.
- All players flip their weapons simultaneously.
- Every player rolls. The total of all player rolls and all weapons must meet or exceed the Shared Combat's difficulty to pass.
