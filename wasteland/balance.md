Survive 7 Days  
==============

N = Number of Players

Every day, a Catastrophe. On the final day? A Super Catastrophe. 

Ideally, only one or two Survivors just barely pull through. 

Radiation Die 
-------------


### Mutation on Pair, Death on 3-of-a-kind ###
- 2 Die : Chance of Mutation: 16%
- 3 Die : Chance of Mutation: 41% : Chance of Death: 3% 
- 4 Die : Chance of Mutation: 62% : Chance of Death: 9% 
- 5 Die : Chance of Mutation: 69% : Chance of Death: 21%
- 6 Die : Chance of Mutation: 61% : Chance of Death: 36%
- 7 Die : Chance of Mutation: 45% : Chance of Death: 54%
- 8 Die : Chance of Mutation: 29% : Chance of Death: 70%
- 9 Die : Chance of Mutation: 15% : Chance of Death: 84% 

In a game 7 turns long, where the player gains 1 rad per turn, what is the probability of survival?  

In a game 7 turns long, where the player gains 1 rad per turn, but loses one Radiation Die, the probability is a much more survivable 60%.

That player will also gain around 1-2 mutation cards.

### Early Game ###

In the first 2 rounds, I want the survivors scrabbling to produce enough food to survive. 

Survivors start with Weapons. No food. 

This means hitting Pinata locations for Weapons and Food. 

We want each players to end the Early Game with 
- 6 food (enough for each player to finish the game and lose 1 food)
- 1 injury, 2 radiation die. 
- 2 weapon
- 1/4 damaged emplacement

There will be 2 Turns, and each Turn should: 

- Provide 4 food / player
- Provide 1/2 injury / player
- Provide 1 radiation die / player
- Provide 1 weapon / player

If we divvy that into Emplacements and Explorations:

Each Starting Emplacement should provide: 
- 1 Food
- 1 Weapon
( 1 Common Salvage, avg. 2 Food/Weapon ) 
- 1 Rad Die. 

Each Exploration should provide: 
- Crisis: -4 Weapon, 18% chance of injury/failure, 18% chance of extra Food/Weapon
- 3 Food 
- 3 Weapon
( 3 Common Salvage, avg. 2 Food/Weapon ) 

At the end of each day, 
- -1 Food 

- One catastrophe: 
 - 33% chance to injure all players and damage 2 emplacement.
 - 1 food loss for everyone 

### Mid Game ###

In the next 3 rounds, I want the survivors to start building up the weapons and emplacements that they need to take Crucial locations.

They should also have N/2 Emplacements. 

This means hitting Bunker locations for Rare Weapons. 

We want the player to end the Mid Game with:
12 Weapon ( from 2 ) 
2 Injury ( from 1 ) 
5 Radiation Die ( from 2 ) 
1 Mutation ( from 0 )
3 Food (from 6)

There will be 3 Turns, and each Turn should: 
- Provide 4 Weapon

- Provide 1/3 of an injury
- Provide 1 Radiation Die

Each Pinata Emplacement should provide:
- Spend 2 Food to draw 4 Common Salvage and 1 Radiation Die
- 4 Weapon 
- 2 Food 
    ( 3 Common Salvage )
- 1 Radiation Die
or
- Repair an Emplacement / The Super Catastrophe cannot damage Emplacements
or
- Trade 2 Common Salvage for 1 Rare Salvage ( +3 Weapon)  
- Trade 4 Common Salvage for 2 Rare Salvage ( +6 Weapon) 
or
- 1 Weapon
- 1 Food
- Draw the entire Stockpile and hand it out. 

Each Exploration should provide: 
- Crisis: -8 Weapon, 1 Radiation Die
- 10 Weapon
- 33% chance of an injury

At the end of each day, 
- -1 Food

- One catastrophe: 
    - Damage 1 emplacement
    - Damage 1 emplacement
    - Every player gains 1 radiation die 

### Late Game ###

In the last few rounds, I want the survivors 
* hunting high-value locations for Rare Salvage 
* clearing their hand of injuries, radiation die, and mutations 
* putting in Emplacements that will help them fend off the Super Catastrophe
* dropping 1 or 2 rad die

This means hitting Crucial locations for Rare Weapons and Emplacements. 

We want the player to end the Late Game with: 
- 16 Weapon ( from 8 ) 
- 0 Food (from 2)
- 1 Injury (from 2)
- 1 Mutation 
- 5 Radiation Die (from 5)

Each Bunker Location should provide: 
- 2 Rare Weapon ( + 10 Weapon ) / +5 Weapon against the Super Catastrophe 
or
- Trash one Injury, one Mutation, or one Radiation Die / Skip Radiation Roll at the end of the Super Catastrophe phase. 
or
-  

Each Exploration should provide: 
- Crisis: -8 Weapon, 1 Radiation Die
- 10 Weapon
- 33% chance of an injury


### Super Catastrophe ###

The final emplacements: 
- Give one Exploring player +3 weapon / Each player gets +3 Weapon against the Super Catastrophe
- Reroll one due during Catastrophe / Each player gets to reroll one die during Super Catastrophe. 

4-Player Super-Catastrophe 

Stage 1: 
One combat, for the entire group, at difficulty 60, pass/fail. 

On a failure, every player takes 3 injury and 3 radiation, destroy 3 emplacements.

Stage 2: 
Each player takes on one Combat, Difficulty 10.

On a failure, that player takes 2 injury and 2 radiation, destroy 1 emplacement. 

Stage 3: 
Radiation Roll.
