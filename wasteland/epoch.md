INTRO
-----

The end has come and gone.  After a century of infinite growth, everything has come full circle.

There is no food. There is no power. The few people who are left squabble over scraps.  

A small group of survivors have banded together and formed a settlement.

Things were going as well as could be expected until the survivors encountered a panicked man from another settlement. 

The man's small settlement had been destroyed by a band of marauders, hundreds strong. And they were headed this way. 

The survivors weren't going anywhere.  They had made a home here. They were going to stand and fight.  

They needed to build a fortress. They had 2 weeks.

- Resolve that Emplacement.
- No Emplacement may be resolved twice in a turn. 
- The First Player token is given to the player to the left of the First Player, unless someone has taken the Outpost location. 
- Place a Common Salvage card on any Emplacement that was not used. This goes to the next player to use that Emplacement.  

#### Exploratory Party ####
- The player who chooses the Exploratory Party location performs 3 actions: 
  - Draws Crisis Cards: 
    - If it is Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, draws 4 Crisis cards. Hands them out, one per player.

    - The new Emplacement may not be used this turn. 
    - The old Emplacement may still be used this turn. 
  - Adds Salvage to the Stockpile. (See the Week Track)  

### NIGHT ###
- First, a Catastrophe. Resolve the current day's Catastrophe. 
- In this phase, each player must produce at least one point of "Food" from a Salvage Card or take a card from the Crisis deck and place it in their hand. 
    - Any surplus Food points generated may be given to other players that they might survive.  
- Each player has a Hand Limit of 7. 
- If any player has more than their cards in their hand than their hand limit, they must discard Salvage cards to the Stockpile until they are down to their hand limit. 
    - If the player cannot discard down to their hand limit (All of the Player's cards are Crisis cards or Mutation cards), the player's Survivor dies. 

DEATH
-----
- Should a Survivor die, that Survivor's Salvage cards are placed in the Stockpile. 
- The dead survivor chooses an emplacement to damage, that is not 'Stockpile', 'Exploratory Party', or 'Outpost'. 

TRASH, STOCKPILE, or PLAY
-------------------------
Cards that are Trashed are placed in a pile next to their respective decks, to be shuffled back in as necessary. 
Cards that are Stockpiled are placed in the Stockpile. 
Cards that are Played are placed in front of the player, and cannot be used again this turn. 

COMBAT
------
- Crisis - Combat cards are events where your character has to fight to proceed. 
- A Combat card will have a Difficulty rating.
- First the player will choose any weapons that he will use in the combat. The player is now committed to use all of these weapons, regardless of outcome.
- The player now rolls a die and adds any weapon modifiers to that die. ( Jeff rolls a 2+4, and now has 6 )
- If the number is greater than or equal to the Combat's difficulty, the player wins! 

SHARED COMBAT
-------------
- Same as a normal combat, but every player contributes die and weapon towards the roll.
