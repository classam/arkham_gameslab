INTRO
-----

The end has come and gone.  After a century of infinite growth, everything has come full circle.

There is no food. There is no power. The few people who are left squabble over scraps.  

A small group of survivors have banded together and formed a settlement.

Things were going as well as could be expected until the survivors encountered a panicked man from another settlement. 

The man's small settlement had been destroyed by a band of marauders, hundreds strong. And they were headed this way. 

The survivors weren't going anywhere.  They had made a home here. They were going to stand and fight.  

They needed to build a fortress. They had 2 weeks. 

DECKS
-----

Emplacement Deck ( Represending locations that your Survivors must protect )
Location Deck ( Representing Locations that your Survivors must visit )
Survivor Deck ( Representing your Survivors ) 
Common Salvage Deck ( Representing useful items your Survivors will accumulate )

WIN/LOSE
--------

This is a co-operative game.  All players win by gathering 10 VP of locations.

All players lose if no Survivors remain alive, if every Emplacement in the Settlement is damaged, if Morale hits 0, or on the night of the 14th day.  

GAME START
----------

- Decide on an object.  This object will be the "First Player's Trophy".

- The last person to have killed a person with his bare hands gets the First Player's Trophy.
    - In the (admittedly likely) case of a tie, choose the first player with a die roll. 

- A survivor starts with 0 Radiation Dice. 
    - A survivor has a "Morale" rating. The survivor starts with this many Morale tokens. 

- All players receive a Survivor Card. 
    - The Survivor Card is placed in front of the player. 

- All players recieve 5 Salvage Cards. 
    - The Salvage Cards compose the player's hand. 

- The "Apartment Building" Location is put into play, in the center of the table. 

- Put the "Tent City", and "Stockpile" Emplacements in play, in the center of the table. Put 3 Common Salvage cards in the Stockpile for every player. 

DAY
---

- A game day consists of 5 phases: 

1. MORNING
3. NOON
4. NIGHT

### MORNING ###
- The Round begins.
- Players may trade cards in this phase.  
- All players with Radiation Dice make a Radiation Roll.  
    - Survivors in the Tent City do not need to make a Radiation Roll. 
- All players, starting from the First Player, may draw 1 card from the "Stockpile" Emplacement, if it is undamaged and there are cards on it.
- Each player, starting from the First Player, must decide whether they will Explore an Existing Location, Explore a New Location, or Stay Home.
    - If they have decided to Explore an Existing Location, they must declare which location.
    - If they have decided to Stay Home, they must decide which Emplacement they will occupy.  


#### Radiation Roll ####
- Roll all of the player's Radiation Dice.
    - On a pair, the player draws a Mutation from the Mutation Deck and adds it to his hand, then discards 1 Radiation Die.
    - On a three-of-a-kind, the player dies. 

### NOON ###
- One at a time, starting from the First Player: 
- Resolve all Explorations. 
- Then, resolve all Emplacements occupied by a player. 
- Then, attack the Settlement. 

#### Explore a New Location ####
- Draw a Location from the Location Deck.
- Draw as many cards from each Deck as are listed on the Location card, shuffle them together, and create a deck with them.
    - Place this deck face-down next to the upturned Location card. We shall refer to this as the "Event Deck"
- Example: 
    LOCATION: Cheese Shop
        Crisis: 7
        Common Salvage: 4
        Rare Salvage: 1
        Survivors: 1
        VP: 1
    - In this case, we would draw 
        - 7 cards from the Crisis Deck, 
        - 4 cards from the Common Salvage Deck, 
        - 1 card from the Rare Salvage Deck, and
        - 1 card from the Survivors Deck, 
        - shuffle them together to make the Mall's Event Deck, and place them face down next to the Mall card. 
- Then, the player draws and resolves the top card from the newly created Event Deck. 

#### Explore an Existing Location ####
- Shuffle the explored location's Event Deck. 
- Draw 3 cards from the top of the explored location's Event Deck.
    - This set of cards is the current Exploration. 
- First, the player resolves all of the Crisis Cards. 
- Then, the player resolves all remaining Cards. 

#### Resolving Emplacements ####
- Each Emplacement has a special ability. 
- Each Emplacement can only be used by one Survivor per turn. 
- If a Survivor cannot use any Emplacements, he must Explore. 

#### Attack the Settlement ####
- Finally, draw a Crisis card for the settlement. 
- If no Survivor is alive and defending the Settlement, place the Crisis Card over an Emplacement. That Emplacement is now damaged and cannot be used. 
- If the Crisis card is a Combat, add one difficulty to the combat. 
    - All players defending may pool their combat dice together.
    - However, if they fail, every player who has participated must take a Crisis Card and add it to their hand.
        - Example: If three players fight Mustard Gas Angels and lose, one player takes the Mustard Gas Angels Crisis Card and adds it to his hand.
            - The other two players take Crisis Cards from the deck and add them to their hands. 
- If the Crisis card is a Collapse, it affects the player closest to the First Player in order. 
- If the Crisis card is a Catastrophe, it affects all players, as usual. 

##### Resolving Crisis Cards #####
- A Crisis Card might be a COMBAT, a COLLAPSE, or a CATASTROPHE
- COMBAT
    - A fight! See the Combat rules for how to deal with these. 
- COLLAPSE
    - Something bad has happened to one player. Resolve the card's effects.  
- CATASTROPHE
    - This is a challenge for every player at the table.  

- If the exploring Survivor dies during an Exploration, all remaining Crisis, Survivor, and Salvage cards from the Exploration are returned to the Location's Event Deck.

##### Resolving Survivor Cards #####
- The player has found a Survivor in the wreckage! 
- The Survivor Card is placed in the Tent City if it is undamaged, or discarded if the Tent City is damaged. 

##### Resolving Salvage Cards #####
- Take any remaining Salvage cards and add them to your hand. 

##### Recovering Locations #####
- If a Location's Event Deck is empty, it has been Recovered!
- The players flip the Location card over to reveal its Emplacement. They then add it to their settlement. 
    - Locations worth 0 VP do not have a matching Emplacement!
- If the players ever have 10 VP worth of Emplacements in their Settlement, they win. 

### NIGHT ###
- Players may once again trade cards. 
- In this phase, each player must produce at least one point of "Food" from a Salvage Card or take a card from the Crisis deck and place it in their hand. 
    - Any surplus Food points generated may be given to other players that they might survive.  
- Each Survivor has a "Health" rating. This number is their hand limit. 
- If any player has more than their cards in their hand than their hand limit, they must discard Salvage cards to the Stockpile until they are down to their hand limit. 
    - If the player cannot discard down to their hand limit (All of the Player's cards are Crisis cards or Mutation cards), the player dies. 
- If the Survivor has no Morale tokens, the Survivor dies. 

DEATH
-----
- Should a Survivor die, that Survivor's Salvage cards are placed in the Stockpile. 
- In the next WAKE UP phase, if there are any Survivors in the Tent City, the player may start anew with this Survivor. 
    - The player takes 3 cards from the Stockpile, and adds 2 cards from the Common Salvage Deck to construct a new Hand.
    - This occurs in order of death. If Drew dies first, (s)he is first in line for a new Survivor if one is found. 
    - The player then starts the WAKE UP phase as normal. 

TRASH, STOCKPILE, or PLAY
-------------------------
Cards that are Trashed are placed in a pile next to their respective decks, to be shuffled back in as necessary. 
Cards that are Stockpiled are placed in the Stockpile. 
Cards that are Played are placed in front of the player, and cannot be used again this turn. 

MEDICAL CARE
------------
- Medical cards may be played at any time. 
- For every point of "Medical" generated, a player may Trash one Crisis card or one Mutation from their hand.  

EVERY SURVIVOR VS. EVERY PLAYER
-------------------------------
- Cards referring to "Every Survivor" refer to every Survivor, regardless of whether or not they are in play.
- Cards referring to "Every Player" refer to every Survivor in active use by a character.

TENT CITY 
---------
- Cards dealing Morale damage to Every Survivor can kill Survivors who are in the Tent City. 
- Survivors in the Tent City do not participate in the Radiation Roll. 
- Survivors in the Tent City do not need to be fed. 

COMBAT
------
- Crisis - Combat cards are events where your character has to fight to proceed. 
- A Combat card will have a Difficulty rating.
- The player will roll as many Combat Dice as he can generate Weapon Points from cards. On a 1, remove that die. 
- The Combat Crisis will roll as many Combat Dice as its Difficulty. On a 1 or 2, remove that die.
- After both rolls, if the player dice >= crisis dice, the player wins the combat and the Crisis is discarded. 
- After both rolls, if the player dics < crisis dice, the player loses the combat and takes the Crisis card into his hand.

SWAPPING SURVIVORS
------------------
- In order to Swap Survivors, both the "Tent City" and "Stockpile" Emplacements must be undamaged.
- When Swapping Survivors, a player must: 
    - Count his Salvage cards.
    - Discard all Salvage cards to the "Stockpile" Emplacement. 
    - Place all of his Mutation and Crisis cards face-down beneath his face-up Survivor, and place this survivor next to the Tent City Emplacement. 
    - Place all of his Radiation dice and Morale tokens on top of the Survivor. 
    - Draw a different Survivor from the Tent City Emplacement. 
    - Form a hand composed of the new Survivor's Crisis and Mutation cards. Draw as many cards from the Stockpile as were discarded to the Stockpile.
    - Place all of the new Survivor's Morale Tokens and Radiation Dice next to the player.
