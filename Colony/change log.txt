Draft 2:
	- No longer able to redirect statistic loss if opponents card would drop you to 0
	- Dead players have their distances increase by 1 each turn. "Floating" heh...
	- Can now target ship parts of untargetable players. Untargetable players are affects by "all players" cards.
	- Added tiers to ship parts
	- Changed Environment, Engine and Hull part rules
	- Removed all cards of the template: Special: "Choose any player: if their X is at 1, distance 0. If not, set their Y to 1.<br><br>AND"
		- Poorly worded and mostly just a pain to figure out. May want something else to dramatically reduce a statistic later.
	- Removed all cards that say to "pull": not enough variance in distances to make this a useful mechanic right now
	- Added "Remains in play" as a card effect
	- When swapping cards, you may play the card you are given.
	- Added another 3 "discard a ship part" cards
