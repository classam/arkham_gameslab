CHANGE LOG:
Draft 2:
	- No longer able to redirect statistic loss if opponents card would drop you to 0
	- Can now target ship parts of untargetable players. Untargetable players are affects by "all players" cards.
	- Added tiers to ship parts
	- Changed Environment, Engine and Hull part rules
	- Removed all cards of the template: Special: "Choose any player: if their X is at 1, distance 0. If not, set their Y to 1.<br><br>AND"
		- Poorly worded and mostly just a pain to figure out. May want something else to dramatically reduce a statistic later.
	- Removed all cards that say to "pull": not enough variance in distances to make this a useful mechanic right now
	- Added a card to put a card on top of your deck from your hand
	- Added card types:
		- "Remains in play"
	- When swapping cards, you may play the card you are given.
	- Added another 3 "discard a ship part" cards
	- Start all statistics at 3 instead of 7
	- Various rules clarifications
	
	REPRINT: All ship parts,
	 NoTitle, NoTitle18-21, NoTitle90, What Now (extras), NoTitle92, NoTitle94, NoTitle200, 104, 22, 85, 86, 97
	 
	 REMOVE: NoTitle3-7, 23-42
