## PIECES ##
## Board ##
The left-hand side of each player board is ship parts. These are abilities that each player may use once they have placed a card in them.

The right-hand side of each player board is Statistics (Food/Morale/Population/Fuel/Military) and Distance.
		
## Cards ##
Cards have a Distance and an Ability listed on them, as well as their type: "OR" or "AND". Cards also have a title and/or flavor text, these have no game value.

Some cards have Remains in play: Round these cards stay in effect until the end of the round.


## SETUP ##
1. Shuffle the card deck.
2. Evenly distribute cards to every player. Any cards that can't be distributed evenly are removed from the game.
3. Give each player a board.
4. Each player sets their Distance to 0/0 and Food/Morale/Population/Fuel/Military to 3.
5. Name your ship!
6. Determine who will go first.

	
## GAME PLAY ##
## Summary of play ##
1. Draw cards.
2. Perform actions.
3. Goal resolution.
4. End of round.
	
## Draw cards ##
- Draw a communal goal.
	- The communal goal cards are requirements that the group must meet before the end of the round, or some catastrophe will befall them!
	- OPTIONAL: If there is someone who isn't playing, or someone who is already dead, that person may draw two communal goals and pick which one to play this round.
- Every player draws 6 cards.

## Perform actions ##

- Each player performs a single action, starting with the first player and going around clockwise. The actions are:
	1. Play a card.
	2. Place a ship part.
	3. Perform an action as allowed by the current communal goal.
- Play continues clockwise until every player has only a single card left in their hand. Players may not play the last card in their hand.
	- If any players have more cards than others, this is ok. Those players (or player) continue playing cards until they have only a single card left.

**Playing a card**

- Pick a card from your hand to play.
- If it says "any player" you may choose to target yourself or any opponent. If it says "opponent", you must target an opponent. If it says "you" or "your", you must target yourself.
- If it is an "AND" card, the text ability affects the player you target, as well as increasing their distance by the amount on the card.
- If it is an "OR" card, you must choose whether to increase any players Distance by the number shown, or to use the Ability.
		
**Placing a ship part**

- You may only perform this action once per round.
- Take a card from your hand and place it in an empty ship part slot you want to build.
- If you place a card in a Tier 0 ship part, you may take a card from the top of your deck and place it into 1 other ship part slot.
- You may only play in a certain Tier if you have that number of ship parts built already.
	- Examples:
		- You may build any Tier 0, regardless of the number of parts you've previously built.
		- You must have 4 ship parts built in order to build Tier 4
		- If you no longer have the tier requirements for a ship part, it remains in effect, but you won't be able to replace it if it is discarded.
- You may only use those ship part abilities that have cards in them.
- When discarding a ship part, as part of it's ability or a card effect, remove the card from the ship part slot and place the discarded ship part card into your discard pile. 
- Any time a ship part slot is empty it is available as a choice to be built.
	

## Goal resolution ##

- Check the communal goal and implement either the success or failure effect on that card based on whether that goal has been passed or failed. 
- Discard the communal goal after finishing the goal action.
	
## End of round ##
- Players discard the card that is remaining in their hand.
	
		
## DYING ##
You die if

- You need to draw from your deck and there are no cards left in it.
- Any one of your dials reaches 0.

Dying doesn't mean you lose, however Dead players may not play any more cards, place cards into their ship parts or be the target of other players abilities. Dead players distances increase by 1 each turn until the game ends.
		
		
## WINNING ##
The game ends when all players are dead. 

Add all of your statistics to your distance - this is your total victory points. The winner is the player who has the highest victory points.
	
	
## MISC/FAQ ##
- Anytime a rule says "may", it means that you may perform the action if you desire.
- If an effect targets a ship part, it target ship parts of players who are not targetable.
