Colony

TODO:
- portrait ship parts (as opposed to landscape) so they can be read
- less cards for 2 people!
- Categories on cards? "good", "bad", "neutral"?

Good things:
- like "add and split" card
- "Hard Burn" is a fun card



That it is fun to play. If I miss this mark, I fail.
That it is easy to play. If you constantly have to reference your opponents boards, or have to keep track of to many variables during a round (or between rounds), or get caught up on which card to play, I fail.
That it is relatively balanced. Some cards will be more powerful than others, that's ok. But I don't want people dying to quickly, or being unable to act. Part of the game is going to be managing your hand such that you don't kill yourself, but it can't be super easy to die. 


"What could be better?" 
"What parts of the game seemed slow?" 
"Would mechanic X be better at maintaining tension than the current mechanic Y?" 
"Why did you enjoy it?


- To get 10 rounds at 6 cards per round for 4 players
	- 10 * 6 * 4 = 240 cards
	
- could change to "when the first player's deck is empty, or first player reaches 0 statistic"
	- make for a shorter game?
							 
- something for driver and/or dead players to do
	- not based on anything physical - can't interact with board or cards
	
- method of determining who "opponent" is
	- "Choose" - I don't like the "choose who wins" type of game
	- "Everyone" - some cards gain much more power when targeting multiple people
		- but could comparatively reduce the power of negative effects
		- Or could "pvp effect" effects - "when used on self, lose X power. When used on everyone, lose X-2 power"
	- "Nearest ship"? Whomever is closest to you on Distance, ties broken by distance within car/table
		- this changes every turn and is hard to have to ask people about
	- Person to left? right? 
	
- Meta-mechanics:
	- Can't be played after X card has been played
	- Unless player X discards card of Y value immediately, something happens
	- boycott or not (from TS)
	- Can't be played until X card is played
	- provides benefit if played as ship part
	- if X card is played later this turn
	- if you have fewer ship parts than opponents
	- discard a card in order to play this
	- if distance < X
	
	- Special: "Choose any player: if their military is at 1, distance 0. If not, set their fuel to 1.<br><br>AND", etc
		- Poorly worded and mostly just a pain to figure out. May want something else to dramatically reduce a statistic later.
	- "Pull a card": currently don't have enough variance in distances to make this a useful card.
		- 2+ is severely bad odds, 1+ is trivially good.
		
- Theme
	- "Colony ship"
	- "You aren't going to make it"
	- "How far can you make it before you run out of time?"
	- Religion, Politics, Technology, Green/Eco
	
- Thoughts:
	- Neither draw nor discard are strictly good cards.
	
	
	
	
WRITTEN
	
- 4 portfolios
	- dials on one side
		- food/morale/population/fuel/military?
		- distance left to destination
		- dials all start at 2
	- distance starts at 0
	- slots for cards on the other
	- draw and discard holders in the middle somewhere
	
- card-based game-play.
	- something similar to Twilight Struggle?
		- draw cards for each round
		- you have to play each card in your hand by the end of the round, except for 1 which is discarded.
		- ways of playing each card:
			- as a ship part
			- to gain distance
			- as event
			- OR cards, AND cards
			- ensure that one can be discarded each round
		- some cards say "player" and can be played on anyone, including self. Others say "opponent".
		- If opponents card reduces a dial to 0, you may choose a different dial to reduce instead.
		- can play as bonus to add onto your ship 
			- can only add one ship part per round 
			- "Space Race" method of discarding card that would overly help your opponent
			- ship parts provide special abilities when played
				- portfolio slots have bonus listed on them
				- have more slots than there are rounds in the game, so you have to choose what special ability you want
				- cards are played face-down in the ship parts area, means that I don't have to add abilities to each card
				- Winning/lossing
- if any of your dials hit 0, you die immediately.
		 - dials are hovering pretty near 0 for most of the game past the first two turns
		 - should be difficult to actually get below 0
	- if you run out of cards, you die immediately
	- Last person to die gets to play out their remaining deck
	- When all decks are empty, person who went the furthest distance is the winner.
		- Or when one deck is empty? 
		- I like the "no one lives" theme. :P
Card notes:
	- "Pull a card" == "draw a card and look at the distance, if greater than the number shown, you get the effect"
	- If you play a card targeting "any player", that player gets the Distance increase.
	- If card says "OR" the target player may choose whether to perform the action or increase their Distance by the number shown.
	- If card says "AND" the target player must perform the event as well as increasing their Distance by the number shown.
	- "Statistic" is food/morale/population/fuel/military
	- "Round" is complete cycle of draw/discard. "Turn" is card play.
