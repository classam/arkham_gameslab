Backseat game

- Deck of common cards
	- shuffle and split into 4 piles so that everyone shares cards, but doesn't have to draw from inconveniently placed common deck
	- To get 10 rounds at 6 cards per round for 4 players
		- 10 * 6 * 4 = 240 cards
	
- 4 portfolios
	- dials on one side
		- food/morale/population/fuel/military?
		- distance left to destination
	- slots for cards on the other
	- draw and discard holders in the middle somewhere
	
- primarily card-based game-play.
	- something similar to Twilight Struggle?
		- draw cards for each round
		- you have to play each card in your hand by the end of the round, except for 1
		- ways of playing each card:
			- as a ship part
			- to gain distance
			- as event
			- OR cards, AND cards
			- ensure that one can be discarded each turn
		- some cards say "player" and can be played on anyone, including self. Others say "opponent".
		- If opponents card reduces a dial to 0, you may choose a different dial to reduce instead.
		- can play as bonus to add onto your ship 
			- can only add one ship part per turn 
			- "Space Race" method of discarding card that would overly help your opponent
			- ship parts provide special abilities when played
				- portfolio slots have bonus listed on them
				- have more slots than there are rounds in the game, so you have to choose what special ability you want
				- cards are played face-down in the ship parts area, means that I don't have to add abilities to each card

			
				
- Winning/lossing
	- if your dial hits 0, you die immediately.
		 - dials are hovering pretty near 0 for most of the game past the first two turns
		 - should be difficult to actually get below 0
	- if you run out of cards, you die immediately
	- Last person to die gets to play out their remaining deck
	- When all decks are empty, person who went the furthest distance is the winner.
		- Or when one deck is empty? 
		- I like the "no one lives" theme. :P
			 
			 
- need something for driver and/or dead players to do
	- not based on anything physical - can't interact with board or cards
- need method of determining who "opponent" is
	- "Choose" - I don't like the "choose who wins" type of game
	- "Everyone" - some cards gain much more power when targeting multiple people
		- but could comparatively reduce the power of negative effects
		- Or could "pvp effect" effects - "when used on self, lose X power. When used on everyone, lose X-2 power"
	- "Nearest ship"? Whomever is closest to you on Distance, ties broken by distance within car/table
		- this changes every turn and is hard to have to ask people about
	- Person to left? right? 

- Mechanics:
	- Draw a card - more play this turn, but you end your game faster.
	- Put a card from your hand into opponents deck. - make them make a hard choice
	- Break a ship part
		- Repair a ship part? Seems unnecessary.

	- Increase one dial, decrease opponents.
	- Increase one dial, increase opponents.
	- Decrease one dial, decrease opponents.
	- Can't be played after X card has been played
	- "For remainder of turn..."
	- Unless player X discards card of Y value immediately, something happens
	- Must discard a card at random, if event good for opponent, occurs immediately. Otherwise, discarded.
	- On a dice-odd (draw distance > X), increase one dial.
	- On a dice-odd, decrease one dial.
	- Place dial X at 1, something good happens.
	- Bad thing happens unless dial X is at Y
	- Split and add 4 to dials controlled by opponents
